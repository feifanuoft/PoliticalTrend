# PolitiTrend

## Documentation
All datasets are in the election_platform_data folder.    
The model code used to generate the model is in the model folder.  
The ui folder contains the code to run the ui, run ui.py directly to get the URL of the web version of the ui.  
data_cleaning.py has the code for data cleaning.  
data_selection.ipynb is the code to integrate the data.  
p_and_c.csv is all the data used to train progressivism and conservatism.  
r_and_l.csv is all the data used to train regulationism and liberalism.  
translation.ipynb is the code used to translate non-English text.  
Change_DataType.py is the code used to standardize the format of the data within the dataset.  
validation and train folders are the training records automatically generated by the system.  

## Introduction
PolitiTrend leverages natural language processing techniques to predict the political stance of text messages. Inspired by ideology tests, it classifies text into economic (regulationism, liberalism) and political-cultural (progressivism, conservatism) spheres.

## Data Processing
Data sourced from [Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/), categorized into four political stances. We implemented data pre-processing steps like lemmatization, stopword, and punctuation removal.


## Results
Our models demonstrate high accuracy but face challenges like misclassification, misuse of softmax outputs, and handling neutral statements. We discuss strategies to overcome these.

Wages have barely budged,regulationism
while the cost of everything from childcare to a college education has continued to rise.,regulationism
"As working people struggle, the top one percent accrues more wealth and more power.",regulationism
It’s no wonder that so many feel like the system is rigged against them.,regulationism
Democrats believe we are stronger when we have an economy that works for everyone,regulationism
"And we can have more economic fairness,",regulationism
"We need an economy that prioritizes long-term investment over short-term profit-seeking,",regulationism
"rewards the common interest over self-interest,",regulationism
"We believe that today’s extreme level of income and wealth inequality—where the majority of the economic gains go to the top one percent and the richest 20 people in our country own more wealth than the bottom 150 million—makes our economy weaker,",regulationism
"our communities poorer,",regulationism
"We believe a good education is a basic right of all Americans, no matter what zip code they live in.",regulationism
"We will end the school-to-prison pipeline and build a cradle-to-college pipeline instead, where every child can live up to his or her God-given potential.",regulationism
"And as the party that created Social Security, we believe in protecting every American’s right to retire with dignity.",regulationism
"We firmly believe that the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street must be brought to an end.",regulationism
Wall Street must never again be allowed to threaten families and businesses on Main Street.,regulationism
"Democrats believe we are stronger when we protect citizens’ right to vote, while stopping corporations’ outsized influence in elections.",regulationism
"We will fight to end the broken campaign finance system,",regulationism
"overturn the disastrous Citizens United decision,",regulationism
in the number of Americans who would lose access to health care and see their rights ripped away.,regulationism
"We can and we will build a more just economy,",regulationism
Democrats believe we must break down all the barriers holding Americans back,regulationism
"If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead and stay ahead.",regulationism
"The system is not working when we have a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages,",regulationism
while most new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.,regulationism
"having access to affordable and quality childcare,",regulationism
—feel out of reach.,regulationism
It is no wonder so many Americans feel like the deck is stacked against them.,regulationism
and other investments will help rebuild the middle class for the 21st century.,regulationism
Democrats believe that the current minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be increased to a living wage.,regulationism
We believe that Americans should earn at least $15 an hour,regulationism
"We should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over time and index it,",regulationism
and create new ways for workers to have power in the economy so every worker can earn at least $15 an hour.,regulationism
"That is why we will support efforts to limit the use of forced arbitration clauses in employment and service contracts, which unfairly strip consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors of their right to their day in court.",regulationism
We will fight to allow workers the right to earn at least seven days of paid sick leave.,regulationism
We will also encourage employers to provide paid vacation.,regulationism
"We will ensure that family caregivers have the support, respite care, and training they need to support their loved ones.",regulationism
"We will create a strong stable paid caregiving workforce to help meet families' needs, by raising wages, improving access to training, and giving workers the opportunity to come together to make their voices heard in support of a stronger system.",regulationism
We will take steps to expand and strengthen the home care workforce.,regulationism
"We will increase investments  to make quality childcare more affordable,",regulationism
"and support the millions of people paying for, coordinating, or providing care for aging relatives or those with disabilities.",regulationism
"Corporate profits are at near-record highs,",regulationism
but workers have not shared through rising wages.,regulationism
Profit-sharing is linked to higher pay and productivity.,regulationism
"we will incentivize companies to share profits with their employees on top of wages and pay increases,",regulationism
while targeting the workers and businesses that need profit-sharing the most.,regulationism
Democrats will continue to fight for those families who suffered the loss of their homes.,regulationism
"Democrats will also combat the affordable housing crisis and skyrocketing rents in many parts of the country,",regulationism
which is leading too many families and workers to be pushed out of communities where they work.,regulationism
create affordable and workforce housing;,regulationism
and preserve neighborhood-serving nonprofit organizations and small businesses.,regulationism
We will keep the housing market robust and inclusive by supporting more first-time homebuyers and putting more Americans into the financial position to become sustainable homeowners;,regulationism
preserving the 30-year fixed rate mortgage; modernizing credit scoring; clarifying lending rules; expanding access to housing counseling; defending and strengthening the Fair Housing Act;,regulationism
"and ensuring that regulators have the clear direction, resources, and authority to enforce those rules effectively.",regulationism
We will prevent predatory lending by defending the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).,regulationism
"Democrats are proud to be the party that created Social Security, one of the nation’s most successful and effective programs.",regulationism
"Without Social Security, nearly half of America’s seniors would be living in poverty.",regulationism
Social Security is more than just a retirement program.,regulationism
"We will fight every effort to cut, privatize, or weaken Social Security, including attempts to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, or reducing earned benefits.",regulationism
"Democrats will expand Social Security so that every American can retire with dignity and respect,",regulationism
"The Democratic Party recognizes that the way Social Security cost-of- living adjustments are calculated may not always reflect the spending patterns of seniors, particularly the disproportionate amount they spend on health care expenses.",regulationism
We are committed to exploring alternatives that could better and more equitably serve seniors.,regulationism
"We will make sure Social Security’s guaranteed benefits continue for generations to come by asking those at the top to pay more,",regulationism
"and will achieve this goal by taxing some of the income of people above $250,000.",regulationism
The Democratic Party is also committed to providing all necessary financial support for the Social Security Administration so that it can provide timely benefits and high-quality service for those it serves.,regulationism
He has referred to Social Security as a “Ponzi scheme” and has called for privatizing it as well as increasing the retirement age.,regulationism
"Democrats will also fight to enact legislation to make sure that the earned pension benefits of Americans will not be cut,",regulationism
and will pay for it by closing tax loopholes that benefit millionaires and billionaires.,regulationism
"We will fight against any attempt by Republicans in Congress or on Wall Street to roll back the Conflict of Interest Rule, which requires that retirement advisors put the best interests of their clients above their own financial gain.",regulationism
"We strongly support the Older Americans Act, which funds critical programs to help seniors remain independent in their own homes and communities.",regulationism
The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a national treasure.,regulationism
"That is why Democrats embrace a vibrant, public Postal Service that offers universal service, and reject any effort to privatize or marginalize it.",regulationism
We are committed to eliminating the unsustainable mandate to “pre-fund” retiree health costs.,regulationism
"And we will work to restore service to appropriate levels, including overnight delivery of first-class mail and periodicals within the same metropolitan area, maintaining six-day and door-to-door delivery, and appointing members to the Board of Governors and the Postal Regulatory Commission who champion a strong public Postal Service.",regulationism
Democrats also advocate for expanding postal services.,regulationism
This includes offering basic financial services such as paycheck cashing and removing statutory restraints on services the USPS may offer.,regulationism
"To do this, we need to educate our people",regulationism
We also need to ensure that all students have the opportunity to learn computer science by the time they graduate from high school.,regulationism
"The Democratic Party will make it easier to start and grow a small business in America,",regulationism
"unlike Donald Trump, who has often stiffed small businesses—nearly bankrupting some—with his deceptive and reckless corporate practices.",regulationism
"By supporting small business and entrepreneurship, we can grow jobs faster in America.",regulationism
We will open up access to credit because we know that small businesses are some of the best job creators in our country.,regulationism
"Meanwhile, the top one-tenth of one percent of Americans now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent combined.",regulationism
Social mobility is far lower than most believe it to be.,regulationism
"To restore economic fairness, Democrats will fight against the greed and recklessness of Wall Street.",regulationism
"Wall Street cannot be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments and making huge profits, all the while thinking that taxpayers will be there to bail them out again.",regulationism
We must tackle dangerous risks in big banks and elsewhere in the financial system.,regulationism
"We must make Wall Street work for the job-creating, productive economy—including by making loans more affordable for small- and medium-sized businesses.",regulationism
We need to prohibit Wall Street from picking and choosing which credit agency will rate its products as well as from imposing excessive fees on consumers.,regulationism
Democrats believe that no bank can be too big to fail and no executive too powerful to jail.,regulationism
It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.,regulationism
"We will also vigorously implement, enforce, and build on President Obama’s landmark Dodd-Frank financial reform law, and we will stop dead in its tracks every Republican effort to weaken it.",regulationism
"We will stop Republican efforts to hamstring our regulators through budget cuts,",regulationism
and we will ensure they have the resources and independence to fully enforce the law and hold both individuals and corporations accountable when they break the rules.,regulationism
We will also continue to protect consumers and defend the CFPB from Republican attacks.,regulationism
"We oppose any efforts to change the CFPB’s structure from a single director to a partisan, gridlocked Commission and likewise oppose any efforts to remove the Bureau’s independent funding and subject it to the appropriations process.",regulationism
"Democrats condemn predatory payday lending, and will protect consumers by defending the CFPB and implementing strong new regulations.",regulationism
"Our goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires.",regulationism
"We support a financial transactions tax on Wall Street to curb excessive speculation and high-frequency trading, which has threatened financial markets.",regulationism
We acknowledge that there is room within our party for a diversity of views on a broader financial transactions tax.,regulationism
"Democrats will not hesitate to use and expand existing authorities as well as empower regulators to downsize or break apart financial institutions when necessary to protect the public and safeguard financial stability, including new authorities to go after risky shadow-banking activities.",regulationism
Banks should not be able to gamble with taxpayers’ deposits or pose an undue risk to Main Street.,regulationism
"Democrats support a variety of ways to stop this from happening, including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall as well as breaking up too-big-to-fail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy.",regulationism
We believe that personnel is policy.,regulationism
We will nominate and appoint regulators and officials who are not beholden to the industries they regulate—people with a track record of standing up to power and safeguarding the public trust.,regulationism
We will crack down on the revolving door between the private sector—particularly Wall Street—and the federal government.,regulationism
We will ban golden parachutes for those taking government jobs.,regulationism
We will limit conflicts of interest by requiring bank and corporate regulators to recuse themselves from official work on particular matters that would directly benefit their former employers.,regulationism
And we will bar financial service regulators from lobbying their former colleagues for at least two years.,regulationism
We will protect and defend the Federal Reserve’s independence to carry out the dual mandate assigned to it by Congress—for both full employment and low inflation—against threats from new legislation.,regulationism
"We will also reform the Federal Reserve to make it more representative of America as a whole,",regulationism
and we will fight to enhance its independence by ensuring that executives of financial institutions are not allowed to serve on the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks or to select members of those boards.,regulationism
"At a time when many of the largest banks have shunned communities across America, Democrats believe that we need to give Americans affordable banking options, including by empowering the United States Postal Service to facilitate the delivery of basic banking services.",regulationism
Large corporations have concentrated their control over markets to a greater degree than Americans have seen in decades,regulationism
—further evidence that the deck is stacked for those at the top.,regulationism
Democrats will take steps to stop corporate concentration in any industry where it is unfairly limiting competition.,regulationism
"We will make competition policy and antitrust stronger and more responsive to our economy today,",regulationism
"enhance the antitrust enforcement arms of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),",regulationism
and encourage other agencies to police anti-competitive practices in their areas of jurisdiction.,regulationism
"We support the historic purpose of the antitrust laws to protect competition and prevent excessively consolidated economic and political power,",regulationism
"We support reinvigorating DOJ and FTC enforcement of antitrust laws to prevent abusive behavior by dominant companies,",regulationism
"and protecting the public interest against abusive, discriminatory, and unfair methods of commerce.",regulationism
"We support President Obama’s recent Executive Order, directing all agencies to identify specific actions they can take in their areas of jurisdiction to detect anticompetitive practices—such as tying arrangements, price fixing, and exclusionary conduct",regulationism
—and to refer practices that appear to violate federal antitrust law to the DOJ and FTC.,regulationism
"eliminate tax breaks for big oil and gas companies,",regulationism
and crack down on inversions and other methods companies use to dodge their tax responsibilities.,regulationism
"We will make sure that our tax code rewards businesses that make investments and provide good-paying jobs here in the United States, not businesses that walk out on America.",regulationism
We will end deferrals so that American corporations pay United States taxes immediately on foreign profits and can no longer escape paying their fair share of U.S. taxes by stashing profits abroad.,regulationism
"In addition, we will shut down the “private tax system” for those at the top,",regulationism
"immediately close egregious loopholes like those enjoyed by hedge fund managers, restore fair taxation on multimillion dollar estates,",regulationism
"At a time of near-record corporate profits, slow wage growth, and rising costs,",regulationism
we need to offer tax relief to middle-class families,regulationism
—not those at the top.,regulationism
We will work to crack down on tax evasion,regulationism
"Donald Trump and the Republican Party would do the opposite and provide trillions in tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations",regulationism
"Trade deals often boosted the profits of large corporations,",regulationism
and public health.,regulationism
and trade negotiations must be transparent and inclusive.,regulationism
"Disparities in wealth cannot be solved by the free market alone,",regulationism
"but instead, the federal government must play a role in eliminating systemic barriers to wealth accumulation for different racial groups",regulationism
"That means expanding community health centers, allowing all families to buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges, supporting states that open up their public health insurance programs to all persons, and finally enacting comprehensive immigration reform.",regulationism
"We will direct more federal resources to lifting up communities that have been left out and left behind, such as the 10-20-30 model, which directs 10 percent of program funds to communities where at least 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years or more.",regulationism
"We will also focus on communities that suffer from persistent poverty, including empowerment zones and areas that targeted government data indicate are in persistent poverty.",regulationism
This is why Democrats will protect proven programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—our nation's most important anti-hunger program—that help struggling families put food on the table.,regulationism
"The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program should be expanded for low-wage workers not raising children, including extending the credit to young workers starting at age 21.",regulationism
"The Child Tax Credit (CTC) should be expanded, for example, by making more of it refundable, or indexed to inflation to stem the erosion of the credit.",regulationism
"We will create good-paying jobs and enhance opportunities by investing in small business, youth employment, and reentry programs for formerly incarcerated people.",regulationism
And we will make investments in affordable housing near good jobs and good schools.,regulationism
We will invest in Indian education from early childhood through higher education.,regulationism
"We will fully fund the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE),",regulationism
and help to recruit and retain qualified teachers for Native learners.,regulationism
Democrats will continue to support President Obama's Generation Indigenous initiative that has made important strides in promoting new investments and increased engagement with American Indian youth,regulationism
", including by continuing efforts to reform the BIE to provide students attending BIE-funded schools with a world-class culturally-based education.",regulationism
"We believe that health care is a core federal trust responsibility,",regulationism
and we support a robust expansion of the health care provided by the Indian Health Service.,regulationism
"We will work to fully fund the Indian Health Service, Tribal, and Urban Indian health care system and",regulationism
"to ensure that all American Indians have adequate, safe, and affordable access to primary care providers, including oral health, mental health practitioners, and substance abuse treatment options.",regulationism
and offer access to housing and employment upon reentry.,regulationism
"We also believe that Puerto Ricans must be treated equally by Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that benefit families.",regulationism
And we support reviewing the feasibility of extending the ACA to all the territories and increasing the Medicaid cap.,regulationism
"And we will fight to reform our broken campaign finance system,",regulationism
"Big money is drowning out the voices of everyday Americans,",regulationism
Democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo.,regulationism
"We need to end secret, unaccountable money in politics by requiring, through executive order or legislation, significantly more disclosure and transparency—by outside groups, federal contractors, and public corporations to their shareholders.",regulationism
And we need to fight to eliminate super PACs and outside spending abuses.,regulationism
without needing to depend on large contributions from the wealthy and the powerful.,regulationism
"curb billionaires’ influence over elections because they understand that Citizens United has fundamentally damaged our democracy,",regulationism
We believe that by making those at the top and the largest corporations pay their fair share,regulationism
"Democrats believe that we should not be contracting, outsourcing, or privatizing work that is inherently governmental in nature, including postal services, school services, and state and local government services.",regulationism
and save families and businesses money on their monthly energy bills.,regulationism
"We will work to expand access to cost-saving renewable energy by low-income households,",regulationism
and oppose efforts by utilities to limit consumer choice or slow clean energy deployment.,regulationism
"Democrats will fight to make sure these workers and their families get the benefits they have earned and the respect they deserve,",regulationism
"We will also oppose threats to the public health of these communities from harmful and dangerous extraction practices, like mountaintop removal mining operations.",regulationism
Those who fail to do so should be held accountable.,regulationism
Democrats also respectfully request the Department of Justice to investigate allegations of corporate fraud on the part of fossil fuel companies accused of misleading shareholders and the public on the scientific reality of climate change.,regulationism
"As a nation, we need policies and investments that will keep America’s public lands public,",regulationism
"But the United States still lags behind other advanced economies in providing high-quality, universal preschool programs to help all of our kids get a strong start to their educations.",regulationism
"A college degree or another form of post-secondary education is increasingly required for jobs that pay a middle-class wage,",regulationism
And the high cost of college has required too many Americans to take out staggering student loans or put a degree out of reach entirely.,regulationism
We are selling our children and our young people short.,regulationism
"Democrats are committed to making good public schools available to every child, no matter what zip code they live in, and at last making debt-free college a reality for all Americans.",regulationism
"Democrats believe that in America, if you want a higher education, you should always be able to get one: money should never stand in the way.",regulationism
"Cost should not be a barrier to getting a degree or credential, and debt should not hold you back after you graduate.",regulationism
"Bold new investments by the federal government,",regulationism
"coupled with states reinvesting in higher education and colleges holding the line on costs,",regulationism
"Democrats are unified in their strong belief that every student should be able to go to college debt-free,",regulationism
and working families should not have to pay any tuition to go to public colleges and universities.,regulationism
"We will also make community college free,",regulationism
Achieving these goals depends on state and federal investment in both students and their teachers.,regulationism
"Whether full-time or adjunct, faculty must be supported to make transformative educational experiences possible.",regulationism
"As we make college affordable for future students,",regulationism
"we will not forget about the millions of borrowers with unsustainable levels of student debt, who need help right now.",regulationism
Democrats will allow those who currently have student debt to refinance their loans at the lowest rates possible.,regulationism
We will simplify and expand access to income-based repayment so that no student loan borrowers ever have to pay more than they can afford.,regulationism
And we will significantly cut interest rates for future undergraduates because we believe that making college more affordable is more important than the federal government making billions of dollars in profit off those loans.,regulationism
Democrats will also fight for a student borrower bill of rights to ensure borrowers get adequate information about options to avoid or get out of delinquency or default.,regulationism
We will hold lenders and loan servicers to high standards to help borrowers in default rehabilitate and repay their debts.,regulationism
We will continue the important Public Service Loan Forgiveness and loan discharge programs begun by the Obama Administration.,regulationism
"Finally, Democrats will restore the prior standard in bankruptcy law to allow borrowers with student loans to be able to discharge their debts in bankruptcy as a measure of last resort.",regulationism
"To make progress toward these goals, the government should offer a moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers so they have the time and get the resources they need to consolidate their loans, enroll in income-based repayment programs, and take advantage of opportunities to reduce monthly payments and fees.",regulationism
"We will create a robust and historic dedicated fund to keep costs down, provide quality education, and ensure dedicated support to improve student outcomes and completion rates.",regulationism
We will continue to crack down on for-profit schools that take millions in federal financial aid—often as their principal source of revenue—and then exploit students and burden them with debt rather than educating them.,regulationism
That is why we will strengthen the gainful employment rule to ensure that for-profit schools enable students to complete their degrees and prepare them for work.,regulationism
"We will go after for-profits that engage in deceptive marketing, fraud, and other illegal practices.",regulationism
We will also exercise our responsibility in oversight over the Department of Education to carry out their obligation to close down those for-profit schools that consistently engage in fraudulent and illegal conduct.,regulationism
It is unacceptable that for-profit schools with low graduation rates keep encouraging their students to take out federal loans they will have trouble paying back.,regulationism
"Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, we will also encourage widespread relief and the forgiveness of debt to those students harmed by the practices of fraudulent institutions.",regulationism
Democrats believe we must have the best-educated population and workforce in the world.,regulationism
"That means making early childhood education and universal preschool a priority, especially in light of new research showing how much early learning can impact life-long success.",regulationism
Democrats will invest in early childhood programs like Early Head Start and provide every family in America with access to high-quality childcare and high-quality preschool programs.,regulationism
and to ensure that early childhood educators are experienced and high-quality.,regulationism
We will ensure there are great schools for every child,regulationism
Democrats know the federal government must play a critical role in making sure every child has access to a world-class education.,regulationism
"We believe that a strong public education system is an anchor of our democracy,",regulationism
while addressing the wellbeing of the whole child.,regulationism
"We also support increased investments in afterschool and summer learning programs,",regulationism
and inspire learning at a time when many students are left unsupervised.,regulationism
We must find ways to encourage mentoring programs that support students in reaching their full potential.,regulationism
"We will focus on group mentoring, which is a low-cost, high-yield investment that offers the benefit of building a supportive network of peers who push one another towards success.",regulationism
Democrats believe all students should be taught to high academic standards.,regulationism
Schools should have adequate resources to provide programs and support to help meet the needs of every child.,regulationism
"We will hold schools, districts, communities, and states accountable for raising achievement levels for all students—",regulationism
"We are also deeply committed to ensuring that we strike a better balance on testing so that it informs, but does not drive, instruction.",regulationism
"To that end, we encourage states to develop a multiple measures approach to assessment, and we believe that standardized tests must be reliable and valid.",regulationism
"We oppose high-stakes standardized tests that falsely and unfairly label students of color, students with disabilities and English Language Learners as failing;",regulationism
the use of standardized test scores as basis for refusing to fund schools or to close schools;,regulationism
We support enabling parents to opt their children out of standardized tests without penalty for either the student or their school.,regulationism
"We will invest in high-quality STEAM classes, community schools, computer science education, arts education, and expand link learning models and career pathways.",regulationism
We will support the use of restorative justice practices that help students and staff resolve conflicts peacefully and respectfully while helping to improve the teaching and learning environment.,regulationism
"It means ensuring children have health care, stable housing free of contaminants, and a community free of violence in order to minimize the likelihood of cognitive delays.",regulationism
"It means enriching early childhood programming to prepare children in areas such as literacy, numeracy, civic engagement, and emotional intelligence.",regulationism
"It means supporting equitable and adequate state funding for public education,",regulationism
Democrats are committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth.,regulationism
"We support democratically governed, great neighborhood public schools",regulationism
"and high-quality public charter schools,",regulationism
and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators.,regulationism
Democrats oppose for-profit charter schools focused on making a profit off of public resources.,regulationism
but should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools.,regulationism
"Democrats have been fighting to secure universal health care for the American people for generations, and we are proud to be the party that passed Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).",regulationism
Being stronger together means finally achieving that goal.,regulationism
"We are going to fight to make sure every American has access to quality, affordable health care.",regulationism
"We will tackle the problems that remain in our health care system, including cracking down on runaway prescription drug prices and addressing mental health with the same seriousness that we treat physical health.",regulationism
"And we will tackle the epidemics of substance abuse and gun violence, which each claim tens of thousands of lives every year.",regulationism
"Democrats believe that health care is a right, not a privilege, and our health care system should put people before profits.",regulationism
"Thanks to the hard work of President Obama and Democrats in Congress, we took a critically important step toward the goal of universal health care by passing the Affordable Care Act, which has covered 20 million more Americans and ensured millions more will never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition.",regulationism
Democrats will never falter in our generations-long fight to guarantee health care as a fundamental right for every American.,regulationism
"As part of that guarantee, Americans should be able to access public coverage through a public option,",regulationism
and those over 55 should be able to opt in to Medicare.,regulationism
This will include removing barriers to states which seek to experiment with plans to ensure universal health care to every person in their state.,regulationism
"By contrast, Donald Trump wants to repeal the ACA, leaving tens of millions of Americans without coverage.",regulationism
"For too many of us, health care costs are still too high, even for those with insurance.",regulationism
"And medical debt is a problem for far too many working families, with one-quarter of Americans reporting that they or someone in their household had problems or an inability to pay medical bills in the past year.",regulationism
Democrats will also work to end surprise billing and other practices that lead to out-of-control medical debt that place an unconscionable economic strain on American households.,regulationism
"Democrats will keep costs down by making premiums more affordable, reducing out-of-pocket expenses, and capping prescription drug costs.",regulationism
And we will fight against insurers trying to impose excessive premium increases.,regulationism
"Democrats will fight any attempts by Republicans in Congress to privatize, voucherize, or “phase out” Medicare as we know it.",regulationism
"And we will oppose Republican plans to slash funding and block grant Medicaid and SNAP, which would harm millions of Americans.",regulationism
We will keep fighting until the ACA’s Medicaid expansion has been adopted in every state.,regulationism
Nineteen states have not yet expanded Medicaid.,regulationism
This means that millions of low-income Americans still lack health insurance and are not getting the care they need.,regulationism
"Additionally, health care providers, clinics, hospitals, and taxpayers are footing a higher bill when people without insurance visit expensive emergency rooms.",regulationism
"We must renew and expand our commitment to Community Health Centers, as well as community mental health centers",regulationism
"These health centers provide critically important, community-based prevention and treatment in underserved communities,",regulationism
"prevent unnecessary and expensive trips to emergency rooms,",regulationism
and are essential to the successful implementation of the ACA.,regulationism
"We will fight for a comprehensive system of primary health care, including dental, mental health care, and low-cost prescription drugs by doubling of funding for federally qualified community health centers over the next decade, which currently serve 25 million people.",regulationism
and create a comprehensive strategy to increase the pool of primary health care professionals.,regulationism
"It is unacceptable that the United States pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and that too many Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 cannot afford to fill their prescriptions.",regulationism
A lifesaving drug is no good if it is unaffordable to the very people who need it most.,regulationism
And many drug companies are spending more on advertising than on research.,regulationism
The largest pharmaceutical companies are making billions of dollars per year in profits at higher margins compared to other industries while many stash their profits in offshore tax havens.,regulationism
"Meanwhile, they charge Americans thousands of dollars for new drugs—often at much higher costs than in other developed nations.",regulationism
"Democrats are committed to investing in the research, development, and innovation that creates lifesaving drugs and lowers overall health costs,",regulationism
but the profiteering of pharmaceutical companies is simply unacceptable.,regulationism
We will crack down on price gouging by drug companies and cap the amount Americans have to pay out-of-pocket every month on prescription drugs.,regulationism
"We will prohibit anti-competitive “pay for delay” deals that keep generic drugs off the market,",regulationism
"and we will allow individuals, pharmacists, and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed pharmacies in Canada and other countries with appropriate safety protections.",regulationism
Democrats will also fight to make sure that Medicare will negotiate lower prices with drug manufacturers.,regulationism
"We must confront the epidemic of drug and alcohol addiction, specifically the opioid crisis and other drugs plaguing our communities, by vastly expanding access to prevention and treatment,",regulationism
"supporting recovery,",regulationism
and promoting better practices by prescribers.,regulationism
The Democratic Party is committed to assisting the estimated 20 million people struggling with addiction in this country to find and sustain healthy lives by encouraging full recovery and integration into society,regulationism
"We will continue to fight to expand access to care for addiction services,",regulationism
and ensure that insurance coverage is equal to that for any other health conditions.,regulationism
"We think it is time for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, and state regulatory agencies to fully implement the protections of the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act of 2008—which means that American medical insurers, including the federal government, will need to disclose how they make their medical management decisions.",regulationism
"We should also do more to educate our youth, as well as their families, teachers, coaches, mentors, and friends, to intervene early to prevent drug and alcohol abuse and addiction.",regulationism
"We should help state and local leaders establish evidence-based, age-appropriate, and locally-tailored prevention programs.",regulationism
These programs include school-based drug education programs that have been shown to have meaningful effects on risky behavior; community-based peer mentorship and leadership programs; and after-school activities that deter drug use and encourage life skills.,regulationism
"We must treat mental health issues with the same care and seriousness that we treat issues of physical health,",regulationism
and promote better integration of the behavioral and general health care systems.,regulationism
we will work with health professionals to ensure that all children have access to mental health care.,regulationism
And we should create a national initiative around suicide prevention across the lifespan—to move toward the HHS-promoted Zero Suicide commitment.,regulationism

We will also stand up to those in positions of power who abuse that privilege.,regulationism

And they are the people who deserve strong and stable leadership from a government that is determined to address the five giant challenges we face – and make the right long-term decisions for the future of the United Kingdom.,regulationism

Regulation is necessary for the proper ordering of any economy and to ensure that people – and their investments – are protected.,regulationism
We will therefore examine ways in which the regulation of utilities and transport infrastructure can be improved to deliver a better deal for customers,regulationism
Markets need rules and these rules need to be updated to reflect our changing economy.,regulationism
"It was a Conservative government that introduced the National Living Wage and as a result, people across the United Kingdom now receive a minimum of £7.50 an hour.",regulationism
"A new Conservative government will continue to increase the National Living Wage to 60 per cent of median earnings by 2020 and then by the rate of median earnings, so that people who are on the lowest pay benefit from the same improvements in earnings as higher paid workers.",regulationism
"Business owners who abuse pension funds and put them at risk, sometimes for their own lavish enrichment, are entirely in the wrong.",regulationism

"A Conservative government will act to tighten the rules against such abuse,",regulationism
"We will build on existing powers to give pension schemes and the Pensions Regulator the right to scrutinise, clear with conditions or in extreme cases stop mergers, takeovers or large financial commitments that threaten the solvency of the scheme.",regulationism
"We will also give the Pensions Regulator new powers to issue punitive fines for those found to have wilfully left a pension scheme under-resourced and, if necessary, powers similar to those already held by the Insolvency Service to disqualify the company directors in question.",regulationism
We will update the rules that govern mergers and takeovers.,regulationism
This will require careful deliberation but we can state now that we will require bidders to be clear about their intentions from the outset of the bid process;,regulationism
that all promises and undertakings made in the course of takeover bids can be legally enforced afterwards;,regulationism
and that the government can require a bid to be paused to allow greater scrutiny.,regulationism
We have already strengthened ministerial scrutiny and control in respect of civil nuclear power,regulationism

Our world-beating universities will lead the expansion of our R&D capacity.,regulationism
"We must help them make a success of their discoveries – while they have a number of growing investment funds specialising in spin-outs, we have more to do to replicate the success of similar university funds in the United States.",regulationism

People have long talked about the need to create UK sovereign wealth funds.,regulationism
We will now make this a central part of our long-term plan for Britain.,regulationism
"We will create a number of such funds, known as Future Britain funds, which will hold in trust the investments of the British people, backing British infrastructure and the British economy.",regulationism
"We anticipate early funds being created out of revenues from shale gas extraction, dormant assets, and the receipts of sale of some public assets.",regulationism
We will encourage pension funds with an interest in joining Future Britain funds to do so.,regulationism
A successful industrial strategy requires competitive and affordable energy costs.,regulationism
"We will therefore commission an independent review into the Cost of Energy, which will be asked to make recommendations as to how we can ensure UK energy costs are as low as possible,",regulationism
"Our ambition is that the UK should have the lowest energy costs in Europe, both for households and businesses.",regulationism
"It is why we want to see universities make their full contribution to their local community and economy, sponsoring local schools and being creative about how they can open up opportunities for local people, especially those from ordinary working backgrounds.",regulationism
"A strong and stable Union, with no divisive Scottish referendum at this time.",regulationism
"A United Kingdom Shared Prosperity Fund, taken from money coming back to the UK as we leave the EU, to reduce inequalities between communities across our four nations.",regulationism
"Its very existence recognises the value of unity – England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales achieve less as two, three, or four, than as the United Kingdom together.",regulationism
"This unity between our nations and peoples gives us the strength to change things for the better, for everyone, with a scale of ambition we simply could not possess alone.",regulationism
"However, we can still do more for the people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",regulationism
The United Kingdom Government has in the past tended to ‘devolve and forget’.,regulationism
This Conservative government will put that right.,regulationism
We want the UK Government to be a force for good across the whole country.,regulationism
"So we will be an active government, in every part of the UK.",regulationism
"We will work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish and Welsh governments, and the new devolved authorities in England, for the benefit of all our people – but that will not be the limit of our actions in the four nations.",regulationism
"The next Conservative government will therefore work to re-establish a strong, stable and inclusive executive at the earliest opportunity.",regulationism
"In some areas, this will require common UK frameworks.",regulationism
"We will improve the co-ordination of government services to veterans, including housing, employment and mental health services, by introducing a Veterans Board in the Cabinet Office.",regulationism
Our nation is made great by millions of people who work every day to serve the public.,regulationism

"Thanks to our school reforms – such as the establishment of free schools and academies, and changes to ensure a rigorous curriculum – there are more good and outstanding schools today than ever before.",regulationism
There are now more than 1.8 million more children in schools rated good and outstanding than in 2010.,regulationism
The proportion of pupils taking core academic subjects at GCSE has almost doubled.,regulationism
There remains a long way to go.,regulationism
"For too many children, a good school remains out of reach.",regulationism
There are still 1 million children in primary and secondary schools rated by Ofsted as ’requires improvement’ or ’inadequate’.,regulationism
"If schools across the Midlands and north of England had the same average standards as those in the south, nearly 200,000 more children would be attending good schools.",regulationism
We need to give every child in our country the best possible education if we are to provide them with the best opportunities in the world.,regulationism
To achieve that ambition we will have to go further in reforming our education system.,regulationism
"So we will continue with our programme of free schools, building at least a hundred new free schools a year.",regulationism
We will prohibit councils from creating any new places in schools that have been rated either ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improvement’ by Ofsted.,regulationism
We will make it a condition for universities hoping to charge maximum tuition fees to become involved in academy sponsorship or the founding of free schools.,regulationism
We will introduce new funding arrangements so we can open a specialist maths school in every major city in England.,regulationism
"We will replace the unfair and ineffective inclusivity rules that prevent the establishment of new Roman Catholic schools, instead requiring new faith schools to prove that parents of other faiths and none would be prepared to send their children to that school.",regulationism
"We will work with the Independent Schools Council to ensure that at least 100 leading independent schools become involved in academy sponsorship or the founding of free schools in the state system, keeping open the option of changing the tax status of independent schools if progress is not made.",regulationism
"We will lift the ban on the establishment of selective schools, subject to conditions, such as allowing pupils to join at other ages as well as eleven.",regulationism
"While the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils stands at 25 per cent across the country, at selective schools it falls to almost zero.",regulationism
Our reforms to what is taught in schools have been profound.,regulationism
We have addressed grade inflation and poor standards and developed a world-class curriculum.,regulationism
"This has meant considerable change for pupils, teachers and schools.",regulationism
"So now we will help them consolidate those gains, starting with the early building blocks of learning.",regulationism
A Conservative government will strengthen the teaching of literacy and numeracy in the early years so that all pupils – regardless of background – get the best possible start in life.,regulationism

The way funding is distributed to schools in England is not fair.,regulationism

We have begun to correct this and in the next parliament we will make funding fairer still.,regulationism

A Conservative government will act in their interests.,regulationism
We will go further.,regulationism
We will introduce a safeguard tariff cap that will extend the price protection currently in place for some vulnerable customers to more customers on the poorest value tariffs.,regulationism

It was wrong and it has been a Conservative government that has helped to put it right.,regulationism
"By introducing the Pensions Triple Lock and the new State Pension, we have lifted the incomes of millions of older people, reducing pensioner poverty to historically low levels.",regulationism
The Triple Lock has worked: it is now time to set pensions on an even course.,regulationism
"So we will keep our promise to maintain the Triple Lock until 2020, and when it expires we will introduce a new Double Lock, meaning that pensions will rise in line with the earnings that pay for them, or in line with inflation – whichever is highest.",regulationism

"Second, to ensure this is fair, we will introduce a single capital floor, set at £100,000, more than four times the current means test threshold.",regulationism
"This will ensure that, no matter how large the cost of care turns out to be, people will always retain at least £100,000 of their savings and assets, including value in the family home.",regulationism
"Third, we will extend the current freedom to defer payments for residential care to those receiving care at home, so no-one will have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care.",regulationism
An efficient elderly care system which provides dignity is not merely a function of money.,regulationism

We support the innovations in education reform occurring at the State level based upon proven results.,laissez-faire
"School choice—whether through charter schools, open enrollment requests, college lab schools, virtual schools, career and technical education programs, vouchers, or tax credits—is important for all children,",laissez-faire
especially for families with children trapped in failing schools.,laissez-faire
"In sum, on the one hand enormous amounts of money are being spent for K12 public education with overall results that do not justify that spending.",laissez-faire
"On the other hand, the common experience of families, teachers, and administrators forms the basis of what does work in education.",laissez-faire
and Congressional Republicans are pointing a new way forward with major reform legislation.,laissez-faire

The first step is to acknowledge the need for change when the status quo is not working.,laissez-faire
The federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans;,laissez-faire
Private sector participation in student financing should be welcomed.,laissez-faire
The resources of the federal government’s law enforcement and judicial systems have been strained by two unfortunate expansions: the overcriminalization of behavior and the overfederalization of offenses.,laissez-faire
Federal criminal law should focus on acts by federal employees or acts committed on federal property – and leave the rest to the States.,laissez-faire
"Then Congress should withdraw from federal departments and agencies the power to criminalize behavior,  a practice which, according to the Congressional Research Service, has created “tens of thousands” of criminal offenses.",laissez-faire
"In the same way, Congress should reconsider the extent to which it has federalized offenses traditionally handled on the State or local level.",laissez-faire
as well as protecting the free flow of information within the private sector.,laissez-faire
The government collects valuable information about potential threats that can and should be shared with private entities without compromising national security.,laissez-faire
We believe that companies should be free from legal and regulatory barriers that prevent or deter them from voluntarily sharing cyberthreat information with their government partners.,laissez-faire
" and  urge  States  to  offer support  for  job  programs,  license reciprocity,  onestop  service  centers,  and  education  programs  to support  these  families.  ",laissez-faire
"The federal Department needs to consider these as partners in assisting vets, recognizing that those closest to the individual can best diagnose a problem and apply a remedy.",laissez-faire
"Limiting foreign aid spending  helps  keep  taxes lower,  which  frees  more  resources  in  the  private  and  charitable  sectors,  whose  giving tends  to  be  more  effective  and efficient.  ",laissez-faire

"In return, the insufficient job search efforts or the refusal of reasonable offers will lead to the suspension of allowances.",laissez-faire

Our country does not always like success: those who succeed arouse a form of jealousy or suspicion.,laissez-faire
"But our country also refuses failure: whether in school or in professional life, those who fail are often pointed out and prevented from trying their luck again.",laissez-faire
"However, we need our fellow citizens to get started, to try, to take initiatives, even if it means helping them bounce if they fail.",laissez-faire
"And we need some of our fellow citizens to succeed, create activity and jobs, causing others with them.",laissez-faire

· We will support private investment.,laissez-faire
· We will lower corporate tax by 33.3% to 25% to reach the European average.,laissez-faire

It is our firm intention to reduce taxes on Britain’s businesses,laissez-faire
"Corporation Tax is due to fall to seventeen per cent by 2020 – the lowest rate of any developed economy – and we will stick to that plan, because it will help to bring huge investment and many thousands of jobs to the UK.",laissez-faire
We know that the business rates system presents considerable challenges to some smaller companies.,laissez-faire
That is why we have supported those businesses most affected by the recent revaluation of business rates.,laissez-faire
That is not all we will do.,laissez-faire
We will make longerterm reforms to the system to address concerns about the way it currently works.,laissez-faire
"We will make sure that revaluations are conducted more frequently to avoid large changes to the bills that businesses face,",laissez-faire
and explore the introduction of self-assessments in the valuation process.,laissez-faire
Britain has always been a great trading nation.,laissez-faire
Trade will continue to be crucial to our future growth and prosperity.,laissez-faire
"As we leave the European Union, we want to negotiate a new deep and special partnership with the EU, which will allow free trade between the UK and the EU’s member states.",laissez-faire
"As part of the agreement we strike, we want to make sure that there are as few barriers to trade and investment as possible.",laissez-faire
Leaving the European Union also means we will be free to strike our own trade agreements with countries outside the EU.,laissez-faire
"We will ensure immediate stability by lodging new UK schedules with the World Trade Organization, in alignment with EU schedules to which we are bound whilst still a member of the European Union.",laissez-faire

"As part of our modern industrial strategy, we will explore how government can do even more to support innovation by small and start-up firms.",laissez-faire
"We also recognise that government can improve the general business environment for SMEs, so we will use our buying power to ensure that big contractors comply with the Prompt Payment Code both on government contracts and in their work with others.",laissez-faire

"We want to make sure that the cost of energy in Britain is internationally competitive, both for businesses and households.",laissez-faire

"As we explain in chapter two, it is why we are determined to move many of the functions of central government out to cities around Britain where possible",laissez-faire
"It is also why we will support local growth through combined authorities, mayoralties and local enterprise partnerships.",laissez-faire
We will wherever possible deliver growth funding through these organisations.,laissez-faire
We will give local enterprise partnerships greater weight by backing them in law.,laissez-faire
Decades of profound economic change have left their mark on coastal communities around Britain.,laissez-faire
We will continue to work to ensure these communities enjoy the vitality and opportunity they deserve.,laissez-faire
"In England, we will extend our successful Coastal Communities Fund to 2022, helping our seaside towns thrive.",laissez-faire
The settlement governing these islands has changed profoundly in the last twenty years.,laissez-faire
Significant decision-making have been devolved to the parliament in Scotland and assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland.,laissez-faire
"Devolved administrations in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast exercise greater powers than equivalent governments elsewhere in the democratic world.",laissez-faire
"In England, we have given considerable powers to city mayors and combined authorities,",laissez-faire
while local councils now have greater control of the taxes they collect.,laissez-faire
"This positive evolution of our constitution has given a voice to people who felt distant from the centre of power, and responsibility to people for their own part of our great country.",laissez-faire
"We will continue to work in partnership with the Scottish and Welsh governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, in a relationship underpinned by pooling and sharing resources through the Barnett Formula.",laissez-faire
We will respect the devolution settlements: no decision-making that has been devolved will be taken back to Westminster.,laissez-faire
"Indeed, we envisage that the powers of the devolved administrations will increase as we leave the EU.",laissez-faire
"This Conservative government has devolved more power to English local authorities, closer to local people, than any previous government in over a century:",laissez-faire
"across England, newly elected mayors, combined authorities, local councils and local enterprise partnerships are being empowered to improve local growth and public services.",laissez-faire
We will continue to give local government greater control over the money they raise and address concerns about the fairness of current funding distributions.,laissez-faire
"The Scottish Parliament has become the most powerful parliament of its kind in the world, with extensive powers over taxation and welfare.",laissez-faire
and only the Conservative and Unionist Party can deliver further powers and the best possible deal for Scotland as we leave the European Union.,laissez-faire
The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union but some would disrupt our attempts to get the best deal for Scotland and the United Kingdom with calls for a divisive referendum that the people of Scotland do not want.,laissez-faire
We have been very clear that now is not the time for another referendum on independence.,laissez-faire
"And as we develop our new trade policies, we will pay particular attention to using the United Kingdom’s muscle to promote Scottish exports around the world.",laissez-faire

A Conservative government will continue to work for the full implementation of the 2014 Stormont House and 2015 Fresh Start Agreements.,laissez-faire
"For too long, power in Britain has been centred in London.",laissez-faire
It is time major cities around Britain shared in the government of the United Kingdom.,laissez-faire
"For our civil service and major cultural bodies to claim to be UK institutions, they need to represent and be present across our whole United Kingdom.",laissez-faire
We will put this right.,laissez-faire
"Starting with the UK Government’s arm’s-length bodies, we will start moving significant numbers of UK Government civil servants and other public servants out of London and the south-east to cities around the UK.",laissez-faire
"We will ensure that senior posts move too, so that operational headquarters as well as administrative functions are centred not in London but around Britain.",laissez-faire
"And we will do so in a way that encourages the development of new clusters of public services, private businesses and, where appropriate, universities.",laissez-faire
"We will pursue free trade with European markets,",laissez-faire
and secure new trade agreements with other countries.,laissez-faire
"As we leave the European Union, we will no longer be members of the single market or customs union but we will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free trade and customs agreement.",laissez-faire
"As powers return from the EU, we will be able to determine the level best placed to take decisions on these issues, ensuring that power sits closer to the people of the United Kingdom than ever before.",laissez-faire
We expect that the outcome will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration,laissez-faire
and doing business within our own union are created.,laissez-faire
We will be the world’s foremost champion of free trade.,laissez-faire
"The United Kingdom will be a global champion for an open economy, free trade, and the free flow of investment, ideas and information.",laissez-faire
"Open and free trade is key to international prosperity, stability and security –",laissez-faire
it is an essential component of an economy that Works for everyone.,laissez-faire
"We believe the UK must seize the unique opportunities it has to forge a new set of trade and investment relationships around the world, building a global, outwardlooking Britain.",laissez-faire
"property entitlements,",laissez-faire
"In order to fund these commitments, we have taken an important decision.",laissez-faire
We do not believe that giving school lunches to all children free of charge for the first three years of primary school – regardless of the income of their parents – is a sensible use of public money.,laissez-faire
There is now good evidence that school breakfasts are at least as effective in helping children to make progress in school.,laissez-faire
"So under a new Conservative government, schools in England will offer a free school breakfast to every child in every year of primary school, while children from low-income families will continue to receive free school lunches throughout their years in primary and secondary education.",laissez-faire
"We will continue to run the welfare system in accordance with our belief that work is the best route out of poverty,",laissez-faire
Britain is an open economy,laissez-faire
and we will always ensure that our British businesses can recruit the brightest and best from around the world and Britain’s world-class universities can attract international students.,laissez-faire
and help companies provide more flexible work environments that help mothers and fathers to share parenting.,laissez-faire
So we will support companies to take on parents and carers returning to work after long periods of absence,laissez-faire
"and back similar schemes in the public sector, including the country’s biggest employer, our NHS.",laissez-faire
We will give employers the advice and support they need to hire and retain disabled people and those with health conditions.,laissez-faire
As we set out in chapter one we want to reduce taxes on British businesses,laissez-faire
and allowing councils to raise more money for care themselves from Council Tax.,laissez-faire
One purpose of long-term saving is to cover needs in old age;,laissez-faire
"those who can should rightly contribute to their care from savings and accumulated wealth, rather than expecting current and future taxpayers to carry the cost on their behalf.",laissez-faire
"Moreover, many older people have built considerable property assets due to rising property prices.",laissez-faire
Reconciling these competing pressures fairly and in a sustainable way has challenged many governments of the past.,laissez-faire
We intend to tackle this with three connected measures.,laissez-faire
"First, we will align the future basis for means-testing for domiciliary care with that for residential care, so that people are looked after in the place that is best for them.",laissez-faire
"This will mean that the value of the family home will be taken into account along with other assets and income, whether care is provided at home, or in a residential or nursing care home.",laissez-faire
"Creating a sustainable elderly care system means making decisions about how the rising budget devoted to pensioners is spent, so we will target help where it is needed most.",laissez-faire
"So we will look at Winter Fuel Payments, the largest benefit paid to pensioners, in this context.",laissez-faire
"The benefit is paid regardless of need, giving money to wealthier pensioners when working people on lower incomes do not get similar support.",laissez-faire
"So we will meanstest Winter Fuel Payments, focusing assistance on the least well-off pensioners, who are most at risk of fuel poverty.",laissez-faire
"Fourth, whilst the NHS will always treat people in an emergency, no matter where they are from, we will recover the cost of medical treatment from people not resident in the UK.",laissez-faire
This remains competitive compared to the costs of health insurance paid by UK nationals working or studying overseas.,laissez-faire
"We will also back the implementation of the plan at a local level, through the Sustainability and Transformation Plans, providing they are clinically led and locally supported.",laissez-faire
and give councils powers to intervene where developers do not act on their planning permissions;,laissez-faire
"We will also give greater flexibility to housing associations to increase their housing stock, building on their considerable track record in recent years.",laissez-faire
This charter has two fundamental aims: that we will make Britain the best place to start and run a digital business;,laissez-faire
"Through our modern industrial strategy and digital strategy, we will help digital companies at every stage of their growth.",laissez-faire
"We will help innovators and startups, by encouraging early stage investment and considering further incentives under our worldleading Enterprise Investment Scheme and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme.",laissez-faire
"We will help digital businesses to scale up and grow, with an ambition for many more to list here in the UK,",laissez-faire
"When we leave the European Union, we will fund the British Business Bank with the repatriated funds from the European Investment Fund.",laissez-faire
"and will seek to build upon the favourable tax arrangements that have helped them, including the highly successful creative industries tax credits scheme.",laissez-faire
"We will ensure there is a robust system for protection of intellectual property when the UK has left the EU, with strong protections against infringement.",laissez-faire
We will make doing business online easier for companies,laissez-faire
We will give businesses the right to insist on a digital signature and the right to digital cancellation of contracts.,laissez-faire
to help smaller companies build their capabilities,laissez-faire
flexible and dynamic use of data,laissez-faire
And we will put small businesses at the centre of our economic strategy.,laissez-faire
We will protect small businesses by reintroducing the lower small profits rate of corporation tax.,laissez-faire
We will also exclude small businesses from costly plans to introduce quarterly reporting,laissez-faire
but that future growth depends on investment.,laissez-faire
Britain can only be stronger if every nation and region is given the resources and support to succeed.,laissez-faire
"Only a Labour government with a credible industrial strategy can reach this untapped potential and deliver prosperity to every corner of our country, working with devolved administrations.",laissez-faire
Trade – by negotiating a new deal with Europe that puts jobs and the economy first.,laissez-faire
We will also encourage private investment by removing new plant and machinery from business rate calculations.,laissez-faire
"The National Investment Bank will fill existing gaps in lending by private banks, particularly to small businesses,",laissez-faire
"Our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of our economy, providing 60 per cent of private-sector jobs.",laissez-faire
"Technological changes, like the spread of digital manufacturing and rapid communication, mean smaller, faster businesses will be the future of our economy.",laissez-faire
Yet this Conservative Government has taken small businesses for granted.,laissez-faire
Labour is the party of small businesses.,laissez-faire
We understand the challenges our smaller businesses face.,laissez-faire
"In order to provide the support many small businesses need, a Labour government will: Mandate the new National Investment Bank, and regional development banks in every region, to identify where other lenders fail to meet the needs of SMEs and prioritise lending to improve the funding gap.",laissez-faire
Reinstate the lower small-business corporation tax rate.,laissez-faire
"Introduce a package of reforms to business rates – including switching from RPI to CPI indexation,",laissez-faire
"exempting new investment in plant and machinery from valuations,",laissez-faire
and ensuring that businesses have access to a proper appeals process,laissez-faire
– while reviewing the entire business rates system in the longer run.,laissez-faire
"Scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with a turnover of under £85,000.",laissez-faire
"Currently, the UK buys and sells energy tariff free from Europe, an arrangement which saves families and businesses money, and helps balance the power grid.",laissez-faire
"As part of the Brexit negotiations, Labour will prioritise maintaining access to the internal energy market.",laissez-faire
Labour will seek a Brexit deal that delivers for all regions and nations of the UK.,laissez-faire
We will introduce a ‘presumption of devolution’ where devolved powers transferred from the EU will go straight to the relevant region or nation.,laissez-faire
"For many people and for much of our country, power can feel just as remote and unaccountable in Westminster as it does in Brussels.",laissez-faire
So a Labour government will seek to put powers as close to communities as possible.,laissez-faire
This will also apply to the funding of peace and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland.,laissez-faire
We will also improve engagement and dialogue with the devolved administrations and seek to ensure the final Brexit deal addresses specific concerns.,laissez-faire
Labour is pro-trade and pro-investment.,laissez-faire
The UK’s future prosperity depends on minimising tariff and non-tariff barriers that prevent us from exporting and creating the jobs and economic growth we need.,laissez-faire
"A Labour government will work with devolved administrations to bring forward an integrated trade and industrial strategy that boosts exports,",laissez-faire
Labour will set out our priorities in an International Trade White Paper to lead a national debate on the future of Britain’s trade policy.,laissez-faire
As our trading relationship with the EU changes it is vital that we retain unrestricted access for our goods and services.,laissez-faire
"Through our Just Trading initiative launched in 2016, Labour will work with global trading partners to develop 'best-in-class’ free trade and investment agreements that remove trade barriers and promote skilled jobs and high standards.",laissez-faire
Labour is committed to the rules-based international trading system of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).,laissez-faire

"We will develop an export incentive scheme for SMEs based on international best practice,",laissez-faire
and we will ring-fence Tradeshow Access Programme grants to help SMEs reach new customers around the world.,laissez-faire

and we will include regional representation on overseas trade missions.,laissez-faire

"Labour will develop capital investment schemes and other incentives to encourage investment into the UK, especially into target areas identified by the industrial strategy.",laissez-faire
"To ensure that we deliver for every part of the UK, we will devolve responsibility for skills, wherever there is an appetite, to city regions or devolved administrations.",laissez-faire
And we will work with the devolved administrations to improve the operation of the levy,laissez-faire
Protect the £440 million funding for apprenticeships for small-and medium-sized employers who don’t pay the levy,laissez-faire
"Self-employment can bring many benefits, freedoms and flexibilities to people – and is a vital and often entrepreneurial sector of our economy.",laissez-faire
and lower costs for employers.,laissez-faire
and give councils new powers to build the homes local communities need.,laissez-faire
and the housebuilding industry.,laissez-faire
Given the particular pressures in London we will look at giving the Mayor the power to give renters in London additional security.,laissez-faire
"Councils deliver vital local services to our communities, but their budgets have been slashed by Conservative cuts.",laissez-faire
"This has led to a deterioration of local services, from bin collection to road repair,",laissez-faire
"and the loss of important community assets such as libraries, youth centres and women’s refuges.",laissez-faire
Labour believes in devolving power to local communities but that requires the necessary funding follows.,laissez-faire
You cannot empower local government if you impoverish it.,laissez-faire
A Labour government will give local government extra funding next year.,laissez-faire
"We will initiate a review into reforming council tax and business rates and consider new options such as a land value tax, to ensure local government has sustainable funding for the long term.",laissez-faire
Labour is the party of devolution and we believe in handing back power to communities.,laissez-faire
"We will devolve powers over economic development, complete with the necessary funding.",laissez-faire
"It is through the planning system that communities can shape the kinds of high streets, homes and amenities that they want.",laissez-faire
"But under the Conservatives, planning has been under-resourced and disempowered, with democratic planning authorities unable to stand up to big developers.",laissez-faire
"As a result, planning decisions have become too influenced by narrow economic considerations, with developers’ profit taking precedence over community priorities.",laissez-faire
A Labour government will properly resource and bolster planning authorities with fuller powers to put people and communities at the heart of planning.,laissez-faire
We will update compulsory purchase powers to make them more effective as a tool to drive regeneration and unlock planned development.,laissez-faire
"Labour will end the closure of Crown Post Office branches, which play a major role in serving their communities.",laissez-faire

community benefits,laissez-faire
"Across the country we will enable councils to provide first-class bus services by extending the powers to re-regulate local bus services to all areas that want them,",laissez-faire
and we will support the creation of municipal bus companies that are publicly run for passengers not profit.,laissez-faire
"Labour will introduce regulations to designate and protect routes of critical community value, including those that serve local schools, hospitals and isolated settlements in rural areas.",laissez-faire
"We will invest in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland too, working with devolved administrations through the UK National Infrastructure Commission and its devolved counterparts.",laissez-faire

A re-elected Conservative Government will maintain and build on this low-tax record.,laissez-faire
We will not raise taxes on the businesses that create jobs for Canadians or on Canadian workers.,laissez-faire
Our “tax lock” legislation will prohibit income and sales tax rate increases and discretionary payroll tax hikes on Canadian businesses and workers for the next four years.,laissez-faire
"Instead, we will carry out our plan to lower the tax rate on small businesses – which we've already lowered from 13 percent to 11 percent – another two percentage points, to nine percent, by 2019.",laissez-faire
This is the largest reduction in the small business tax rate in a quarter century.,laissez-faire

"and in 2014 we created the two-year Small Business Job Credit to provide more than $550 million in payroll tax relief for 780,000 job-creating businesses across the country.",laissez-faire

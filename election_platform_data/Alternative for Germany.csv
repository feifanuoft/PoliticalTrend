33,227,Ensure the separation of powers,H,
34,228,Numerous laws and political practice have put the separation of powers in Germany as the core element of the rule of law over the years,202.1,

108,302,The EU directive on the protective provider protection is inadequate.,110,
109,303,We call for a uniform German law with understandable clear rules and a corresponding adaptation of civil service law.,110,
110,304,Internal whistleblower channels prescribed for us are important components of such a law,201.2,

113,307,The totalitarian tendencies have also accepted a degree of democracy in Germany.,202.1,
114,308,The unconstitutional opening of the border and the massive fundamental rights restrictions in the name of the Corona crisis were the previous highlights in the daily break of law and constitution by government politicians.,605.1,
115,309,The mainstream media have given up their elementary task as fourth violence,202.1,
116,310,and critical-objective reporting for government praise.,304,
117,311,So often only alternative media and whistleblower remain in the event of uncovering and disclosure in the government's injustice.,304,
118,312,"For this reason, anonymous whistle is indispensable for the uncontraction of corruption, abuse of power and other crimes in politics, administration, business and civil society organizations.",304,
119,313,Civil-- Freedom Law,H,
120,314,The principles of equality before the law,503,
121,315,And bourgeois freedom of contract are among the great civilizational achievements of Europe.,202.1,
122,316,"During the most part of human history, it was part of the unquestioned normality that people were unequal due to birth or stand unequal and in their legal self -determination, right up to the extreme rightlessness in the form of serfdom or slavery.",601.1,
123,317,Only the Christian and humanistic culture of the European peoples produced the aforementioned principles and realized it in a centuries -long process.,601.1,
124,318,"In the past few decades, a departure from these basic European values has been afraid.",601.1,
125,319,It is important to counter this civilization step backwards.,601.1,
126,320,"Article 3 of the Basic Law states: ""Men and women are equal.",503,
127,321,The state promotes the actual enforcement of equality between women and men and affects the elimination of existing disadvantages.,503,
128,322,"Nobody can be disadvantaged or preferred because of their gender. """,503,
129,323,These sentences have a clear and good sense.,503,
130,324,The right not to be disadvantaged by the state based on your own sex is an individual human right.,201.2,
131,325,Every person is in the same way.,201.2,
132,326,"Some lawyers represent the false thesis, Article 3 of the Basic Law, the state allows individual people to be preferred or disadvantaged for their respective gender in order to ""equalize the genders presented as collectives"".",201.1,
133,327,"However, in a liberal constitutional state, it can never be a legitimate goal of enforcing a ""gender quota"" that is equally arbitrarily defined in arbitrarily delimited areas of social areas.",201.1,
134,328,Nor can a legally prescribed unequal treatment be a means of realizing equality.,201.1,
135,329,Laws that prescribe such are unconstitutional and rejected.,201.1,
136,330,The AfD will work in the German Bundestag for its cancellation.,305.1,
137,331,The alternative for Germany occurs to preserve or restore bourgeois self -determination in civil law.,201.1,
138,332,"That is why we reject so -called, anti -discrimination laws.",201.1,
139,333,"The central basic value of a free civil law is freedom of the contract, i.e. the freedom of each individual, to decide whether he wants to enter into legal relationships with another citizen.",201.1,
140,334,"Under the influence of the European Union, this fundamental principle of private autonomy in German legislation is destroyed step by step.",110,
141,335,"In a free basic order, the state is subject to the duty of equal treatment in its actions towards the citizen, but the citizen himself is free to design his private legal relationships.",201.1,
142,336,A cancellation of this separation between the state and society damages the freedom nature of the legal system and opens the door and gate for a totalitarian ruling order.,201.1,
143,337,The AfD will campaign in the German Bundestag against this development and for the preservation of a free private law order.,201.1,

147,341,We are committed to a Europe of the father countries as a community of sovereign states that work together in all those areas that can be better designed together.,108,
148,342,This includes in particular a free trade with fair competition.,401,
149,343,"In the sense of a prospering and peaceful Europe, a state -like European Union, as it is sought by the established parties, is counterproductive.",110,
150,344,"Self -responsible nation states, designed by lively democracies, cannot be replaced by over -national institutions.",110,
151,345,A group of neighboring states can cooperate constructively and peacefully on international law.,107,

160,354,A Union of European countries will only have a future if it succeeds in the ever faster rotating wheel of de -democratization,202.1,
161,355,"and to reach centralization into the spokes,",301,
162,356,Before today's EU perish by the perverted idea of its founding idea.,110,
163,357,"The unusual idea of a unit currency for states, which is completely different, has failed.",110,
164,358,It was a political idea that cannot be reconciled with economic laws.,110,
165,359,"With the introduction of the so-called ""Corona re structure package"", the transfer union was lifted into a new dimension.",110,
166,360,"This transfer union does not only contradict the European contracts and the promise of German politicians,",110,
167,361,but will result in the relegation of all European economies and conflicts between the states.,110,
168,362,The EU shows a comparable failure in the long -lasting migration crisis.,110,
169,363,Crisis management in the Corona crisis was also devastating.,110,
170,364,The EU is driving the undesirable developments in climate and energy policy through unimaginably costly law and subsidy packages.,110,
171,365,The long-term disaster of these debt and redistribution escapades will particularly affect German taxpayers.,110,
172,366,The vehemence with which the European Union has promoted the transformation to the planned economy super state in recent years has brought us to the realization that our fundamental reform approaches in this EU cannot be realized.,110,
173,367,We consider Germany's exit from the European Union and the establishment of a new European Economic and Interest Group.,110,
174,368,taxes and finances,H,
175,369,No EU taxes,H,
176,370,The right to collect taxes must remain completely in the national competence of the Member States of the European Union.,110,
177,371,Tax revenues determine national households.,601.1,
178,372,Budget sovereignty represents the central control option of parliament on government action.,202.1,
179,373,The introduction of several taxes required by the EU Commission in connection with the “Recovery Fund” in the EU Commission in the EU's legal settlement and earnings must therefore be prevented.,110,
180,374,For a tax system with few tax types and understandable system,H,
181,375,The tax reform concept of the former constitutional judge Kirchhoff is a good example of a large reform.,303,
182,376,"In the event of concentration on the two large tax types (sales tax and income tax), the property tax, trade tax and several, according to their amount, could be omitted without replacement at the federal level.",303,
183,377,"For example, energy tax, sparkling wine tax and the coffee tax.",303,
184,378,"At the state level, the beer tax and at the local level should be eliminated by the amusement tax, the snack permission tax, the hunting and fishermen and the second home tax.",303,
185,379,They all have in common that they are administrative and weak.,303,
186,380,They do not make any significant contribution to state financing.,303,
187,381,Abolition of substance taxes,H,
188,382,The situation is similar with the so -called substance taxes.,401,
189,383,"This includes the already mentioned property tax, which is based on house and property ownership, the wealth tax as well as the inheritance and gift tax.",401,
190,384,"With currently around 800 billion annual tax revenue of the overall state, their share is overall at a low single -digit percentage.",401,
191,385,"In addition, the wealth tax was declared unconstitutional in 1995.",401,
192,386,The property tax is regulated in the legislative sovereignty of the federal government.,401,
193,387,Their advent only flows to the municipalities.,401,
194,388,She was also declared unconstitutional because of the evaluation problems of the basic and building.,401,
195,389,"Their tax -systematic survey is unclear, which is why their authorization to exist and its constitutionality in law is high.",401,
196,390,"If it is a second wealth tax in truth, which speaks a lot for, it is also confiscation and therefore to abolish.",401,
197,391,Their volume corresponds to about 10 % of the total tax revenue of the municipalities.,401,
198,392,"As a replacement for the municipalities, the AfD strives to change the distribution key of the large types of tax in favor of the municipalities.",401,
199,393,"Basically, the aim of the AfD is to significantly reduce tax and tax burden in Germany (according to OECD only exceeded by Belgium worldwide!)",401,
200,394,It is important to stop the massive emigration of German companies and specialists abroad in recent years,412,
201,395,and to make the business location Germany attractive for investments.,402,
202,396,The economic structure of Germany is extremely strongly shaped by medium -sized companies on a scale.,402,
203,397,"They employ the relative most employees, train the Moisten apprentices by far and often exist over several generations.",402,
204,398,"In the event of a transition in the inheritance, in particular within the family, even more drastically on the company substance by means of inheritance tax, with the result of the destruction of functioning companies.",401,
205,399,Cross -generational preservation of value for the benefit of all of us has been prevented for decades by socialist equality and class -fighting feelings of envy.,401,
206,400,The AfD opposes this.,401,
207,401,Inheritances are initially matters between waterproofers and heirs.,401,
208,402,There is no acceptable reason to make tax cases from mourning cases.,401,
209,403,The AfD therefore calls for the abolition of inheritance tax.,401,
210,404,We want to become a country of apartment owners,H,
211,405,The acquisition of land and residential property is subject to real estate transfer tax.,401,
212,406,"It is measured in percent of the acquisition costs and makes it difficult to form the ownership of broad sections of the population,",401,
213,407,who strive for the acquisition of housing property as the goal of a self -determined life.,201.1,
214,408,Germany is the country across Europe with less than 50 % with the slightest property rate for housing care.,401,
215,409,We want to change this and make it easier to acquire residential property by abolishing real estate transfer tax when purchasing real estate for self -use.,401,
216,410,"Decades ago, there was a one -time real estate tax exemption for the acquisition of self -used housing ownership under certain conditions.",401,
217,411,Elementary tax justice instead of nominal value principle and unequal treatment of tax citizens,H,
218,412,"Since there is almost always a certain inflation of the money, it was and is an act of gross injustice, the progressive table burden on income and the assessment bases, which are significantly determined by allowances, exemptions, lump sums and flat rates, to leave (nominal of long periods of time (""Cold progression"").",503,
219,413,"In the event of an inflation of 2 % annually, allowances melerate by over 20 % of their originally legally wanted monetary value within 10 years.",503,
220,414,The same applies to the disproportionately rising tax burden with only nominal income growth by fixing the control table.,503,
221,415,"Since the 18th legislative period of the Bundestag, individual laws have been adapted to inflation by individual laws and the basic allowances and the table amounts have now also increased.",503,
222,416,"In the decade of this, however, this did not happen, with the result that in Germany, for example in stark difference to Switzerland, one is already being loaded with the top tax rate with a slightly above -average income.",401,
223,417,It is a commandment of elementary justice to carry out automatic legislative dynamization for both phenomena.,401,
224,418,This was therefore repeatedly requested by the AfD parliamentary group in the application.,401,
225,419,"Tax justice is just as elementary if the solidarity surcharge, which was introduced for reasons for financing the structure of the east, does not also apply after the loss of these transfer services.",401,
226,420,"The decisive constitutional lawyers consider the now complete abolition of the ""solos"" to be constitutionally imperative.",401,
227,421,"The AfD parliamentary group has already made several requests in the Bundestag to vote, all of which were rejected by a majority.",401,
228,422,"With effect for 2021, the tax surcharge has now been abolished for lower and medium -sized income groups - with the consequence that about half of the 20 billion of the annual volume is eliminated.",401,
229,423,"However, the second half of the volume remains - for example for all Kleine GmbH - for the other income taxpayers as an additional burden.",401,
230,424,The principle of equal treatment of all taxpayers is blatantly violated.,401,
231,425,The Federal Constitutional Court will have to decide on the legality of this procedure.,201.2,
232,426,Adjust taxation at digital age: Introduction of a digital tax,H,
233,427,"The AfD calls for the introduction of a digital tax for tech giants (""Gafam""), which is not raised on the profit but on the turnover of these companies.",403,
234,428,"It is conceivable to tax sales from the placing of personalized advertising on the basis of user data, sales from mediation services between users and sales from the sale of user data.",403,

1047,1241,It is not conveyed to anyone that professional politicians acquire high pension claims after just a few years.,304,
1048,1242,This is mainly critical because the beneficiaries of these laws themselves have legally decided on such regulations.,304,

4,"Put France in order, in five years.This is the commitment I make.My project contains 144 major measures that will be detailed to you throughout the campaign.I wanted, by this approach, to allow you to control my action at the head of the state during the five -year term.Without this control, there is no healthy democracy.The objective of this project is first of all to return its freedom to France and the word to the people.Because it is in your name, and for your only benefit, that any national policy must be carried out.I also want to return their money to the French, because for too many years, our social and fiscal policy has impoverished the middle and popular classes, while it enriches multinationals and dilapid public money via completely uncontrolled immigration.My project, you can see, is a real proximity revolution.Democratic proximity: I want decisions to be made as close as possible to citizens and directly controlled by them.Economic proximity: it is a question of redeveloping our territory, of finding public services there everywhere, of relocating our businesses and therefore our jobs.No more French, no more French ends, including overseas for which I have already presented my full project, should be forgotten.You are aware of this, this presidential election will face two visions.The “globalist” choice on the one hand, represented by all my competitors, who seeks to destroy our great economic and social balances, which wants the abolition of all borders, economic and physical, and which always wants more immigration andless cohesion between the French.The patriotic choice of the other, which I embody in this election, which defends the nation and the people at the heart of any public decision and which above all wants the protection of our national identity, our independence, the'Unity of French, social justice and prosperity of all.This choice between two major visions, it will be yours, it will be a choice of civilization.And he will also engage the future of our children.",,

"PLATEFORME ÉLECTORALE PCC 2015  OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN TO PROTECT THE ECONOMY  FOREWORD BY PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER",NA,NA
"In this election, Canadians have a clear choice: a choice that carries the greatest of consequences for our economy, for our jobs, and for our families.  Amid a global economy that is once again weak and in turmoil, Canada's economy remains stronger than most – but it's fragile, and needs protection from instability elsewhere in the world.  On October 19, Canadians will choose which party has the best plan, in these troubled times, to protect our economy and protect your job.  Because our economic vision for Canada is so different from that of our opponents, your choice will make a huge difference. Wrong government decisions on taxes, spending, and deficits will expose our economy to harm, and ultimately put the jobs of hard-working Canadians at risk.  For Conservatives, protecting Canada's economy is our number one priority.   That's why we have a positive plan to protect the economy and create jobs over the next four years, and beyond.  We'll:  Keep the federal budget balanced.  Lower taxes on small businesses and workers.  Aim to create another 1.3 million new, well-paying jobs by 2020.  Open new markets for Canadian businesses and products through the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Aim to add more than 700,000 new homeowners by 2020.  Provide new tax relief and benefits to familiesand seniors.   Our plan will keep Canada's economy moving forward.   It's the right plan for our economy.  It's the right plan for Canadians.   Of course, we'll also continue to protect Canadians in a dangerous and uncertain world, keeping our streets and communities safe.   But ultimately, all of these things depend on a strong and growing economy.  So the choice in this election is this: Which government do you trust to manage and protect the fragile Canadian economy, and your job, in the face of global economic turmoil?  Our Conservative Party is the only party with a proven economic record and a low-tax, balanced budget plan for the future.   Permanent deficits, higher taxes, and more debt, as proposed by the Liberals and the NDP, will wreck our economy, cost you money, and possibly your job.   This platform sets out a different, better plan for the next four years. It's our plan to make this country – the greatest country in the world – even stronger and more prosperous for hard-working Canadian families, now and for generations to come.   It's our Economic Action Plan. It's working. Let's continue on with what we know works.",NA,NA

"EXPANDED TRADE",NA,NA
"Canada is a trading nation and we've made historic strides to open new markets for Canadian businesses and their workers.","407",NA
"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is the largest free trade deal in history.","407",NA
"It provides almost 800 million new customers throughout the Asia-Pacific region for Canadian goods and services.","407",NA
"Membership in this agreement is a good deal for Canada, one that will create jobs and opportunities and protect our economy.","407",NA
"FAMILY HOME",NA,NA
"Homeownership is a key way to support Canadian families.","504",NA
"And we're helping more Canadians become homeowners by providing new support to buy and invest in their homes.","504",NA
"Now one in seven Canadian households owns their own homes – one of the highest rates in the industrialized world.","504",NA
"And, under our plan for affordable, responsible homeownership, we'll aim to add more than 700,000 new homeowners by 2020.","504",NA

"This is our positive plan to protect Canada's fragile economy and keep it moving forward for the next four years.","410",NA
"OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR A BALANCED BUDGET AND LOW TAXES",NA,NA
"To protect Canada's economy, a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Ensure the federal budget remains balanced","414",NA
"Control government spending","414",NA
"Keep the tax burden low","414",NA
"Continue to reduce Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio","414",NA
"Maintain our balanced budget legislation","414",NA
"Pass “Tax Lock” legislation to prohibit tax increases in the next four years","414",NA
"Budgets don't balance themselves.","305",NA
"Canadian families and small business owners understand that.","305",NA
"So does our Conservative Government.","305",NA
"Keeping Canada's public finances on a solid footing involves hard work and tough choices.","305",NA
"And that's what we've done.","305",NA
"Our Conservative Government has controlled spending, lowered taxes, and kept Canada's debt levels the lowest in the G-7 by far.","414",NA
"This serves as the fiscal foundation for our plan for Canada's economy.","414",NA
"A balanced budget lets us return more money back into the pockets of hard-working families.","414",NA
"The federal tax burden is now at its lowest in over half a century.","414",NA
"A balanced budget lets us maintain our low debt levels.","414",NA
"Low public debt means less taxpayer money dedicated to interest payments and makes it easier for businesses to borrow and invest at a low cost.","410",NA
"A balanced budget lets us make targeted, affordable investments to protect our fragile economy and help families.","414",NA
"This is the basis for our recent enhancement to the monthly Universal Child Care Benefit, our historic infrastructure investment, and the new measures set out in our plan for the next four years.","504",NA
"A balanced budget allows us to protect key programs such as health care and education without having to make deep spending cuts,","504",NA
"like previous Liberal governments.","305",NA
"A balanced budget ensures that we're not passing on a massive debt burden to our children and grandchildren.","414",NA
"It's for these reasons that our Conservative Government has been so committed to balancing the budget.","414",NA
"A balanced budget is the anchor for our low-tax plan that's helping Canadian families and protecting Canada's fragile economy.","414",NA
"We ran a temporary deficit in 2009 to help protect and create jobs in the face of the worst global economic recession since the 1930s.","409",NA
"But as part of our Economic Action Plan, we also set out a clear, credible plan to return to a balanced budget.","414",NA
"And we've been focused on that plan ever since.","414",NA
"Unlike the previous Liberal government,","305",NA
"we've continued to increase transfer payments to the provinces and territories for health care and education as we promised.","301",NA
"And we've kept taxes low.","414",NA
"Instead, we've eliminated the deficit by controlling government spending,","414",NA
"by eliminating waste and duplication,","303",NA
"and by getting rid of outdated or ineffective programs.","303",NA
"Our plan is working.","305",NA
"We returned to balance in 2014-15 – a full year ahead of schedule.","414",NA
"And, according to the Department of Finance, we're on track for the second balanced budget in a row this year.","414",NA
"Canada's sound public finances are the envy of the world, a source of our economic strength, and a re-elected Conservative Government will ensure they remain that way.","305",NA
"Spending beyond our means, as the Liberals and NDP would have us do, would cause structural deficits that would damage our economy,","305",NA
"lead to tax hikes and program cuts,","305",NA
"and burden future generations with heavy debt.","305",NA
"We need only to look around the world at countries like Greece to see the consequences of profligate and irresponsible spending.","305",NA
"That's not our plan, and not the way forward for Canada.","305",NA
"We'll continue to advance our low-tax, balanced budget plan for jobs and growth,","410",NA
"and we'll continue to operate in the black, spending sensibly within our means and keeping the books balanced.","414",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will balance the budget every year in the next four years","414",NA
"while keeping taxes low,","410",NA
"increasing transfers to the provinces and territories for health care and education,","301",NA
"and making affordable investments to protect the economy and help Canadian families.","410",NA
"We'll accomplish this by controlling the growth of direct program spending","414",NA
"and maintaining the operating budget freeze for one more year.","414",NA
"These steps will provide the fiscal room to make the affordable investments set out in our plan","410",NA
"and ensure that the budget remains balanced without raising taxes.","414",NA
"Our plan is based on the fiscal projections in the 2015 Budget presented in April.","305",NA
"These projections were based on independent, expert advice from Canada's leading private-sector economists, and include contingencies of up to $3 billion per year to account for the current global economic uncertainty.","305",NA
"Put simply: Canadians can count on us to keep the budget balanced and taxes low in the next four years.","414",NA
"We're so committed to these goals, we'll entrench them in law.","414",NA
"Our balanced budget legislation ensures that the only acceptable deficit is one that responds to a recession or truly extraordinary circumstances.","414",NA
"Deficits outside of these rare scenarios are unacceptable.","414",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will follow the Federal Budget Balanced Act to keep spending under control, the budget balanced, and taxes low.","414",NA
"We will also continue to reduce Canada's debt burden to meet our debt-to-GDP target of 25 percent by 2021.","414",NA
"Canada now has the lowest debt levels by far among G-7 countries,","414",NA
"and we'll make sure our children and grandchildren aren't forced to pay the price for reckless borrowing and spending.","414",NA
"Canadians know they can trust us to lower their taxes and keep them low.","305",NA
"This is a major point of difference between our Conservative Party and the Liberals and NDP.","305",NA
"These two parties have promised some combination of higher taxes on individuals, families, seniors, and small businesses","305",NA
"– including taking away income splitting","305",NA
"and eliminating Tax- Free Savings Accounts in whole or in part.","305",NA
"Our low-tax pledge is rooted in our record.","305",NA
"Canadians know that we'll do what we say and that we'll manage taxpayer dollars responsibly.","305",NA
"But unlike the Liberals and NDP, we're prepared to go even further and entrench our low-tax plan in legislation.","305",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will pass legislation imposing a “tax lock” that prohibits increases to federal personal and business income tax rates, sales tax rates, and discretionary payroll taxes over the next four years.","414",NA
"This pledge backs our low-tax commitment with the force of the law.","414",NA
"AT RISK",NA,NA
"Our Conservative Government is the only party in this election with a clear plan to keep the budget balanced and taxes low.","305",NA
"Not only do we have a clear track record, but we're putting forward new measures to ensure the budget stays balanced and the tax burden continues to fall.","305",NA
"The Liberals and NDP have put forward plans to run large, permanent deficits, hike taxes on workers, families, and small businesses, and leave our economy exposed.","305",NA
"They'll do this by:   Adding billions of dollars in new spending, running ongoing, permanent deficits, and accumulating billions more in debt.","305",NA
"Repealing our balanced budget legislation so they can run deficits without being accountable to Canadians.","305",NA
"Putting important programs like health care and education at risk as a result of their reckless and irresponsible spending.","305",NA
"Eliminating the Family Tax Cut which is providing up to $2,000 in tax relief for 1.7 million families.","305",NA
"Taking away the monthly Universal Child-Care Benefit which is providing nearly $2,000 per year for children under age 6, and more than $700 per year for children aged 6 to 17.","305",NA
"The UCCB goes to all the nearly four million families with children.","305",NA
"Shutting down Tax-Free Savings Accounts which are helping 11 million Canadians save and grow their savings tax-free.","305",NA
"Cancelling Pension Income Splitting which is providing one million senior couples with more than $1 billion annual tax relief.","305",NA
"Hiking payroll taxes – as much as $1,000 per year for someone making $60,000 – on Canadian workers and small businesses.","305",NA
"Driving up the price of everything Canadian families buy – including gasoline, groceries, and home heating fuel – by imposing carbon pricing schemes on the Canadian economy.","305",NA
"OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR A STRONGER ECONOMY",NA,NA
"To protect our economy and create jobs, a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Aim to create 1.3 million new jobs by 2020","410",NA
"Cut taxes on small businesses from 11 to 9 percent","402",NA
"Lower payroll taxes on small businesses and workers by more than 20 percent","402",NA
"Implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement","407",NA
"Provide new incentives for manufacturers to purchase equipment","411",NA
"and invest in new technologies","411",NA
"Grant tax relief to businesses that hire apprentices","411",NA
"As much of the rest of the world continues to struggle with the fallout from the recent global financial recession, Canada has emerged in a position of relative strength.","305",NA
"We have one of the best job-creation records in the G-7.","305",NA
"Indeed, since the depths of the global recession, 1.3 million net new jobs – mostly well-paying, full-time positions in the private sector – have been created.","305",NA
"That's more Canadians working than before the recession.","305",NA
"That's more Canadians working than ever before in our country's history.","305",NA
"And it's so much more than just a number.","410",NA
"With every job created, there's another Canadian who knows the dignity of supporting his or her family, and another family with a brighter future.","410",NA
"Having a good job is the difference between worrying about today and dreaming about tomorrow – which is why the creation of new, well-paying jobs for Canadians will continue to be our top priority.","410",NA
"The best way to ensure more and better jobs is to create the right conditions for our enterprising businesses to do what they do best.","410",NA
"Businesses create jobs and opportunities that make our economy stronger, and the new products and ideas that make our lives better.","410",NA
"That means continuing with our Conservative plan to balance the budget, keep taxes and debt low,","414",NA
"open new markets for Canadians products,","407",NA
"make smart, affordable investments in the economy,","410",NA
"and support entrepreneurs and small businesses as they hire and grow.","410",NA
"Keeping our budget balanced","414",NA
"and lowering taxes on small businesses is the right way for government to protect Canada's fragile economy and create jobs.","402",NA
"The other parties have a different vision.","305",NA
"The Liberals and NDP believe that they can raise taxes, run deficits, and accumulate more government debt without killing jobs.","305",NA
"But all you have to do is look around the world to see the consequences of that type of high-tax, high-debt agenda.","305",NA
"It saps small business ingenuity and diminishes the reward for innovation and hard-work.","305",NA
"It punishes success and discourages entrepreneurs from entering the market.","305",NA
"It chokes off job creation and, ultimately, wrecks economies.","305",NA
"In Canada, it would mean more Canadians out of work and looking for jobs.","305",NA
"Canadians simply can't afford the high-tax agenda of the Liberals and NDP.","305",NA
"The path forward is clear: only a re-elected Conservative Government will continue to implement its low-tax, balanced budget plan to protect Canada's economy","414",NA
"and create jobs.","410",NA
"This is the right path.","305",NA
"It's working.","305",NA
"And we intend to keep moving forward.","305",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on our job-creation record by implementing a positive plan to create 1.3 million net new jobs by 2020.","410",NA
"KEEPING TAXES LOW",NA,NA
"We understand that keeping taxes low helps small businesses to grow and create new, well-paying jobs.","410",NA
"Because of our low-tax, balanced budget plan for jobs and economic growth, Canada has the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment of all the major advanced economies,","410",NA
"and our tax rate on small businesses continues to fall.","410",NA
"Canada is now often cited as one of the best countries in the world in which to do business.","410",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will maintain and build on this low-tax record.","402",NA
"We will not raise taxes on the businesses that create jobs for Canadians or on Canadian workers.","402",NA
"Our “tax lock” legislation will prohibit income and sales tax rate increases and discretionary payroll tax hikes on Canadian businesses and workers for the next four years.","402",NA
"Instead, we will carry out our plan to lower the tax rate on small businesses – which we've already lowered from 13 percent to 11 percent – another two percentage points, to nine percent, by 2019.","402",NA
"This is the largest reduction in the small business tax rate in a quarter century.","402",NA
"The Liberals and NDP have promised to raise payroll taxes on workers and small businesses by billions of dollars.","305",NA
"But we know that lower payroll taxes encourage small businesses to hire more Canadians, and to pay them higher wages.","410",NA
"That's why we've worked so hard to keep those taxes down.","305",NA
"Our low-tax record is clear.","305",NA
"We have kept payroll taxes low","402",NA
"and in 2014 we created the two-year Small Business Job Credit to provide more than $550 million in payroll tax relief for 780,000 job-creating businesses across the country.","402",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to lower these taxes.","402",NA
"Beginning in 2017, when the current freeze on EI premiums expires, we will lower them by more than 20 percent – a substantial benefit to Canadian small businesses and workers.","402",NA
"Our small businesses will be able to hire even more workers, and for 16 million Canadian workers, it'll mean a significant salary raise.","402",NA
"We're the only party - the only ones that can be trusted - to keep taxes low on small businesses and their workers for the next four years.","305",NA
"OPENING MARKETS FOR CANADIAN BUSINESSES",NA,NA
"From the days of the French and British traders who first laid the foundations of our modern economy, Canada has been a trading nation.","407",NA
"Trade is the lifeblood of our economy.","407",NA
"It accounts for 60 percent of our GDP, and one in five Canadian jobs.","407",NA
"Canadian businesses and workers know instinctively that we can compete with the world's best as long as the playing field is level.","407",NA
"We also know that we're better off when our goods and services can reach global markets without barriers and restrictions.","407",NA
"Yet previous governments failed Canadians when it came to negotiating trade access for Canadian products.","305",NA
"While other countries were busy signing free-trade deals and receiving preferential access to important markets, the Liberals weren't even at the negotiating table.","305",NA
"And Canadian businesses and workers suffered.","305",NA
"Our Conservative Government has reversed this inaction and opened up new markets for Canadian products and services.","407",NA
"When we took office Canada had free trade agreements with only five other countries.","305",NA
"We've now reached agreements with 44, countries, encompassing more than half the global marketplace, including historic trade deals with South Korea and the European Union, with its 500-million person, $18-trillion economy.","407",NA
"These agreements have given Canadian businesses and their workers access to more than half the global marketplace.","407",NA
"Yet there's more to accomplish.","407",NA
"In the past few days we have concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with 11 other founding countries, including the United States, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.","407",NA
"The TPP is the largest free trade deal in history.","407",NA
"It gives  greater access for Canadian goods and services to almost 800 million consumers throughout the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region.","407",NA
"It's a great deal for Canada that will significantly benefit our economy and Canadians' prosperity.","407",NA
"The TPP will protect and create jobs,","407",NA
"grow Canada's economy,","407",NA
"and provide financial security to workers and businesses in all regions of the country.","407",NA
"It guarantees preferential access for Canadian goods and services in a range of sectors including agriculture and agri-food, fish and seafood, forestry, metals and mining, and manufactured industrial goods.","407",NA
"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a historic agreement that will protect and create jobs, and grow Canada's economy now and in the future.","407",NA
"That's why a re-elected Conservative Government will ratify and implement the TPP.","407",NA
"As part of the TPP negotiations, we've defended and protected Canada's supply management system, as we committed to.","407",NA
"We've limited access to only three and one quarter percent of our dairy market.","703",NA
"And we've announced key programs to ensure Canada's supply-managed sectors -- and the communities that depend on them -- continue to thrive.","703",NA
"To ensure stability for supply-managed farmers through the implementation of our trade agreements, we've established long-term income and quota guarantee programs.","703",NA
"And we're supporting investment in cutting-edge technologies for our processing sector and marketing of world-class Canadian products, which are of the highest quality.","411",NA
"Free trade only works when it's also fair – and this means a modern and effective system of remedy when a Canadian company has been treated unjustly.","407",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will take steps to modernize our system and ensure that it's comparable with the practices and policies of our main trading partners.","407",NA
"To this end we'll:   Mandate the Canada Border Services Agency to carry out a full investigation of trade complaints even in cases when preliminary reviews by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal come back negative.","407",NA
"Require the Canadian International Trade Tribunal to carry out an automatic five-year review of every finding of non-compliance, to ensure the conflict has been resolved in a satisfactory manner.","407",NA
"Continue to work with stakeholders such as the Canadian Steel Producers Association to ensure that the system is effective and accessible, and ultimately creates a level-playing field for Canadian businesses.","407",NA
"The federal government provides a wide range of programs and services to firms looking to invest in Canada and to Canadian businesses trying to sell their goods and services abroad.","407",NA
"These initiatives help attract investment and job creation in Canada","407",NA
"and support export-oriented Canadian businesses in their search for new market opportunities and new customers.","407",NA
"There remains, however, room for improvement.","403",NA
"The system can be difficult for small firms to navigate.","403",NA
"Government efforts to attract investment and promote job creation can sometimes be stymied by a lack of coordination.","407",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will establish an Investment and Trade Promotion Office with a mandate to coordinate the government's various efforts to encourage businesses in other countries to invest in Canada,","407",NA
"and to promote Canadian exports abroad.","407",NA
"The Office will be a one-stop shop to attract investment and product mandates to Canada","407",NA
"and help growing Canadian businesses enter new markets.","407",NA
"CUTTING RED TAPE",NA,NA
"Small businesses should be focused on creating jobs, not filling out paperwork.","303",NA
"That's why our Conservative Government has made it a priority to reduce bureaucratic red tape.","303",NA
"We've passed world-leading “One-for- One” legislation that requires bureaucrats to eliminate a current regulation before establishing a new one.","303",NA
"We've taken steps to harmonize Canadian regulations with those of our major trading partners.","407",NA
"And we've improved the way we consult with small business owners about government policy.","303",NA
"The result of all this is a dramatic change in the culture of the federal government, putting unprecedented emphasis on the needs of Canadian small businesses.","303",NA
"And the benefits so far are clear: Small businesses are now spending $32 million less sorting through regulatory red tape.","303",NA
"That's hundreds of thousands of working hours Canadians are now spending building their businesses instead of filling out forms.","303",NA
"But there's always more that can be done.","303",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on this record by:   Launching a new round of consultations, asking small business owners across the country for feedback on our current reforms and suggestions for future measures.","303",NA
"Expanding the “red tape baseline,” increasing significantly the scope of the red tape burden subject to the One-for-One rule.","303",NA
"And with a more comprehensive baseline, challenging ourselves to reduce the overall burden by 20 percent.","303",NA
"We'll achieve this goal while maintaining the highest standards in all areas, including health and safety.","303",NA
"To achieve our 20 percent target we will take short-term, immediate action to cut red tape in ways that are real, measureable and meaningful to Canadians.","303",NA
"We'll work with the Retail Council of Canada to better harmonize Canada's child car seat regulations with the United States.","303",NA
"This will reduce the red tape burden for our retailers,","303",NA
"and at the same time allow them to offer greater choice and better prices to Canadian parents with young families.","401",NA
"And we'll make life easier for the 1.2 million Canadians who claim home-office expense deductions, 80 percent of whom are self-employed.","504",NA
"Anyone who makes a claim once will be able to use the same cost estimates, adjusted for inflation, in subsequent years.","303",NA
"MANUFACTURING STRATEGY",NA,NA
"In a fast-changing world, here's one thing that hasn't changed: Canada's manufacturing sector is absolutely vital to our growing economy.","410",NA
"It accounts for about 11 percent of our GDP, 61 percent of Canadian exports, and provides good, secure jobs to almost 1.7 million Canadians across the country.","410",NA
"Indirectly, it employs many millions more.","410",NA
"Manufacturing firms pay out $1.85 billion weekly in salaries to Canadian workers across the country.","410",NA
"But what is changing is the nature of the work.","411",NA
"It's becoming more skilled, more specialized, and more globally competitive.","411",NA
"Liberal leader Justin Trudeau says that manufacturing's time is passed, that it's time for Canada to “transition away” from manufacturing.","305",NA
"Our Conservative Government disagrees.","305",NA
"Manufacturing has played a key role in Canada's economy since before Confederation – and, with the right plan, will continue to sustain high-quality, high-paying jobs and economic activity across the country.","410",NA
"Our Conservative Government has a positive plan to sustain our manufacturing sector.","410",NA
"We're:   Lowering taxes to make it easier for manufacturers to invest in advanced technology and equipment.","411",NA
"Helping Canadians acquire the skills and training they need to take advantage of new opportunities in manufacturing.","411",NA
"Opening new markets for manufacturers to find customers and sell their products.","407",NA
"Making strategic investments to encourage research and development and the creation of new products and technologies.","411",NA
"This is what our manufacturing strategy is all about.","305",NA
"And it's working.","305",NA
"Manufacturing wages are up nearly 20 percent since we've come to office.","410",NA
"But there's more to be done to support what the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters have called our “manufacturing renaissance.”","410",NA
"Manufacturers need to invest in new machinery and equipment to remain globally competitive, expand their businesses, and create good new jobs.","410",NA
"To help with this, we've reduced taxes steadily on these investments.","402",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will carry out our ten-year plan to lower the tax burden on Canadian manufacturers that acquire the machinery and equipment they need to succeed.","402",NA
"Canada is attracting high-quality, value-added manufacturing investment.","410",NA

"This will help to create a stable, predictable environment for new automotive investment in Canada.","402",NA
"In addition, we'll change the program's parameters in the immediate term to include bricks and mortar as eligible expenses","402",NA
"and offer grants rather than repayable loans for greenfield investments and investments in existing facilities that guarantee a long-term presence and operation.","402",NA

"or obtain credential recognition for their international training.","411",NA
"Having the right skills is often the key to finding a new job or getting a pay raise.","411",NA
"As part of this agenda, our Government has always made a priority of supporting apprenticeships and Canadians working in the skilled trades.","411",NA
"These are the people who are literally building this great country,","411",NA
"and one estimate predicts that Canada will need one million more skilled workers by 2020.","411",NA
"One measure we've taken to help young Canadians launch careers in the skilled trades is the Apprenticeship Job Creation Tax Credit.","411",NA
"The program has been a resounding success, with the number of businesses using this tax credit rising six fold – from about 2,000 to almost 12,000 and nearly 68,000 apprentices.","411",NA
"To build on this success, and to encourage more employers to create more jobs for the next generation of skilled workers, a re-elected Conservative Government will take further steps to support those who wish to enter the skilled trades","411",NA

"But too often they find it challenging to pursue their careers here because of difficulties having their professional credentials recognized, leaving them under-employed and unable to maximize both their own potential and their contribution to our country.","503",NA
"In fact, this problem costs the Canadian economy about $2 billion every year.","503",NA
"Our Government has worked hard to help new Canadians in this position.","503",NA
"In 2011 we launched a pilot program that provided loans to support new Canadians who needed help with training and licensing to have their international credentials recognized here in Canada.","411",NA
"It was a significant success, distributing 2,000 loans across the country – and recovering more than 99 percent of the money lent.","411",NA
"So in Economic Action Plan 2015, we made this program permanent.","411",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on this success story by doubling the size of the program,","411",NA

"The great distance between major shipping hubs and some of our most remote communities drives up prices, making feeding a family a much more expensive undertaking than in the rest of the country.","504",NA
"Our Conservative Government is committed to helping people in Northern communities enjoy the kind of healthy diet all Canadians enjoy,","504",NA
"and has invested significantly in the Nutrition North program, which subsidizes the cost of food shipped to communities in northern Canada.","504",NA
"But the program can be improved.","504",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will require that all retailers have a point-of-sale system for the Nutrition North program so that Northern customers can clearly see on their grocery receipts how and when the Nutrition North subsidy is applied.","403",NA

"– it's about giving the people of the North more say in their own future, and greater control over their own destiny.","301",NA

"A strong and prosperous North is key to a strong and prosperous Canada.","410",NA
"This is why our Government has worked hard to promote economic development in the North through an unprecedented number of important investments in infrastructure, including airports, marine facilities, and roads.","411",NA
"These investments benefit Northerners in real and significant ways.","411",NA
"First, making it more efficient to transport goods brings down prices, and lower prices make it easier to live, work and raise a family in the North.","411",NA
"Second, investments in infrastructure create new jobs and opportunities for Northerners.","411",NA
"Better infrastructure also improves Northerners' quality of life by making it easier and safer to get around.","411",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on its record of infrastructure investment by improving the section of Highway 5 running through Wood Buffalo National Park and connecting Hay River to Fort Smith, NWT – widening it, replacing drainage culverts, and hard-surfacing the last 68-kilometre stretch that currently remains a gravel road.","411",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support the Strategic Investments in Northern Economic Development program to finance economic development projects in the territories.","402",NA

"It's always been our goal to make Canada the best country in the world in which to raise a family.","603",NA
"Now raising a family is hard work, and we believe it's work best left to the experts: Mom and Dad.","603",NA
"We believe that in a Canada of low taxes, good jobs, safe streets and the opportunity to prosper, they can do the rest – and that's what we're delivering.","603",NA
"That's why, when it comes to taxes, our Conservative Government is committed to taking as little as possible, and giving back as much as we can – especially to lower- and middle-income families.","503",NA
"In fact, the federal tax burden is now at the lowest level in over 50 years.","503",NA
"This principle has been at the heart of our Conservative Government's agenda since taking office.","503",NA
"It's why we:   Lowered the GST from seven to six to five percent.","503",NA
"Established, and then enhanced, the monthly Universal Child-Care Benefit.","504",NA

"As a result of our Conservative plan, the typical Canadian family now has more than $6,600 in their pockets every year – real benefits, real relief, that they can count on.","505",NA
"We understand the financial pressure that families face, and we're focused on helping these families make ends meet.","505",NA
"Our plan leaves every family with children with more money in their pockets to spend on their priorities,","505",NA
"and the long-term financial security to pursue those priorities with confidence.","505",NA
"We want every family to succeed,","505",NA
"and we'll help by lowering their taxes and giving them the freedom to choose what's best for them.","505",NA
"And that's what a re-elected Conservative Government will continue to do.","505",NA
"We'll pass legislation imposing a “tax lock” on increases to federal income tax rates and sales tax rates, and discretionary payroll taxes over the next four years.","505",NA
"This pledge backs our low-tax commitment with the force of the law.","505",NA
"THE FAMILY HOME",NA,NA
"For most Canadians, the family home is their biggest asset and their most significant investment in their future financial security.","706",NA
"It's also the focus of their lives – where they raise their children, relax with friends and family, and enjoy their golden years.","706",NA
"That's why our Conservative Government believes it's vitally important to help Canadians become homeowners,","706",NA
"to help them maintain and increase the value of their homes,","706",NA
"and to make changes through renovations as their needs and circumstances evolve.","706",NA
"Our plan for affordable, responsible homeownership is working.","305",NA
"Canada now has one of the highest homeownership rates in the world and exceeds that of the United States for the first time in decades.","305",NA
"Homeownership is a key way to support Canadian families.","706",NA
"And there's more we can do to help aspiring homeowners buy and invest in their homes.","706",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will set a target to add more than 700,000 new homeowners by 2020.","706",NA
"If this goal for affordable, responsible homeownership is reached, we'll see the number of Canadian homeowners exceed 10 million.","706",NA
"The Home Buyers' Plan allows aspiring homeowners to make tax-free withdrawals from their Registered Retirement Savings Plans to finance the purchase or new construction of their first home.","706",NA
"In 2009, our Conservative Government increased the allowable withdrawal from $20,000 to $25,000 – the first increase since the program was established a generation earlier.","706",NA
"This has become an important method of financing for first-time homeowners, benefiting almost 200,000 Canadians a year.","706",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will raise the Home Buyers' Plan limit once again, from $25,000 to $35,000.","706",NA
"With this increase we will continue to help families achieve the pride and stability of having a place to call their own.","706",NA
"The Home Renovation Tax Credit, originally established by our Government in 2009 as a temporary measure, was a resounding success.","305",NA
"About one in every three households took advantage of this program, saving more than three million Canadians, on average, more than $700 each.","305",NA
"It also pumped $4.3 billion into our national economy, in tough economic times.","305",NA
"It was such a success story – so good for Canadian families, and so good for the Canadian economy – that a re-elected Conservative Government will enact a new permanent Home Renovation Tax Credit, available each year for substantial home renovation expenses up to $2,500, beginning in January 2017, and $5,000, beginning in January 2019.","504",NA
"Given the importance of homeownership, our Government wants to make sure it remains a dream within reach for the average Canadian family.","706",NA
"Some reports have suggested that speculative foreign non-resident buyers are a significant factor in driving homes out of the price range of average families, especially in Vancouver and Toronto.","403",NA
"If speculators are driving up the cost of housing to unaffordable levels, that's something the government can and should address.","403",NA
"Other countries, like Australia, have put in place regulations that limit the ability of foreign buyers to purchase existing houses for investment purposes.","403",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will compile comprehensive data on the acquisition of Canadian real estate by foreign non-residents and temporary residents,","403",NA
"and, if this is contributing to putting the dream of homeownership out of reach of Canadians, we'll work in coordination with provincial governments to take the appropriate action.","301",NA
"SAVING FOR A CHILD'S EDUCATION",NA,NA
"Part of ensuring Canadian children get the best possible start in life is helping their parents begin saving for their future education.","506",NA
"Our Conservative Government has a solid record of making it easier for families to save and prepare for their children's education,","305",NA
"including providing tax relief on scholarships and bursaries,","506",NA
"and targeting student grants to low- and middle-income students.","506",NA
"One of the ways we've helped families is through Registered Education Savings Plans.","506",NA
"These plans allow Canadians to invest money tax-free until it's time to pay that first tuition bill.","506",NA
"Because we realize how important this is, our Conservative Government has contributed significantly to Canadian families' RESPs, through matching grants.","506",NA
"In 2014, we helped 2.59 million children invest in their future, including 900,000 children from low- and middle-income families who received enhanced, targeted grants.","506",NA
"But we want to help even more.","506",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will:   Double the enhanced grant for middle-income families from 10 cents to 20 cents per dollar on the first $500 contributed each year.","506",NA
"Double the enhanced grant for lower-income families from 20 cents to 40 cents per dollar on the first $500 contributed each year.","506",NA
"$2,200 more per student or roughly a half year's tuition costs in additional government support, assuming a reasonable rate of return.","506",NA
"This new commitment builds on policies in our Economic Action Plan 2015 that will make life easier and more affordable for post-secondary students and their families including:   Eliminating in-study income from the Canada Student Loans Program assessment so that students can work, earn money, and gain valuable experience while studying without affecting their loan eligibility – helping 87,000 students per year.","506",NA
"Reducing the expected parental contributions from the Canada Student Loans Program assessment to better recognize the financial realities faced by Canadian families – increasing support to approximately 92,000 students.","506",NA
"Expanding the number of low- and middle-income students eligible for the Canada Student Grant program by making these grants applicable to short-term, vocational programs.","506",NA
"SAVING FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT",NA,NA
"Canadians know the value of saving, whether it's for a car, for college or university, for a family vacation, or just for a rainy day.","706",NA
"And we believe in encouraging Canadians to save, which is why we've expanded significantly their ability to do so.","706",NA
"No two families are exactly alike, and imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to saving would be wrong for Canada and wrong for Canadians.","706",NA
"Instead, we're making it easier for Canadians to save money in whatever way works best for them and their families.","706",NA
"We want all Canadians to be able to dream big, knowing their hard-earned money will be there for them when they need it.","706",NA
"Saving for retirement is major priority for Canadians.","706",NA
"That's why our Conservative Government has consistently lowered taxes to leave Canadians with more take-home pay and expanded the range of voluntary options for them to save for their future.","706",NA
"Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) have become the single most important personal savings vehicle in decades.","706",NA
"Nearly 11 million Canadians have opened an account and the total value of assets held is about $120 billion.","706",NA
"Low- and middle-income Canadians have have benefited significantly – about half of TFSA holders earned less than $42,000.","706",NA
"Put simply: TFSAs have become a place where almost one in three Canadians keep and grow their dreams.","706",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will protect the TFSA and the recent doubling of the annual contribution limit to $10,000 per year.","402",NA
"We'll also take further steps to help Canadians save for retirement and to lower taxes on Canadian seniors by:   Giving seniors significantly greater flexibility in managing their retirement income by reducing the minimum withdrawal requirements for Registered Retirement Income Funds.","504",NA
"Raising the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption from $500,000 to 750,000 to $800,000 and indexing it.","504",NA

"Canadian seniors have earned our gratitude for a lifetime of hard work in service to our families, our communities, and our country.","706",NA
"They have helped make Canada the strong and prosperous country that it is today,","706",NA
"and they deserve to enjoy their senior years in dignity and financial security.","504",NA
"Our Conservative Government has cut taxes and is making life more affordable for Canadian seniors, including single and widowed seniors.","504",NA
"We've:   Introduced Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), which 2.7 million Canadian have now opened.","402",NA
"Income earned and withdrawals from TFSAs don't affect eligibility for the Age Credit, Old Age Security, and the Guaranteed Income Supplement.","504",NA
"Enhanced the TFSA in 2015 to allow Canadians to contribute up to $10,000 each year, with seniors to receive 60 percent of the benefits from this new contribution limit.","504",NA
"Enacted Pension Income Splitting for seniors to benefit more than 2.2 million Canadian seniors each year, with average federal tax relief of $900 annually.","504",NA
"Improved the rules for Registered Retirement Income Funds to allow seniors to preserve more of their retirement savings.","504",NA
"Increased the Age Credit amount by $2,000, to provide up to $1,055 in annual tax relief for seniors.","504",NA
"Announced the biggest increases in a generation to the Guaranteed Income Supplement to help Canada's most vulnerable seniors.","504",NA
"Doubled, to $2,000, the maximum amount of income eligible for the Pension Income Credit.","504",NA
"Created, in 2015, a new, permanent Home Accessibility Tax Credit for seniors that provides up to $1,500 in tax relief each year.","504",NA
"The results of our low-tax, balanced budget plan for Canada's seniors are clear.","305",NA
"Since 2006, we have cut taxes on Canadian seniors by $3 billion each and every year.","504",NA
"Almost 400,000 seniors have been removed from the tax rolls completely.","504",NA
"And now a single senior can earn at least $20,360 and a senior couple at least $40,720 before paying any federal income tax.","504",NA
"Yet single and widowed seniors are among Canada's most vulnerable citizens and face unique financial challenges.","706",NA
"The cost of living can be high for single seniors living on a fixed income.","706",NA
"And when a senior becomes widowed, he or she can lose access to some benefits their spouse received and can face difficult financial circumstances as a result.","706",NA
"In response, a re-elected Conservative Government will establish an “equivalent-to-spouse” Pension Income Credit for single and widowed seniors.","706",NA
"This $2,000 Single Seniors Tax Credit will extend tax relief to nearly 1.6 million single and widowed seniors.","706",NA
"Through this new tax relief, our Conservative Government is making an affordable, targeted commitment to Canada's single seniors, who deserve our respect and financial support.","706",NA
"HELP FOR CANADIANS WITH DISABILITIES",NA,NA
"The moms and dads who care for a child with a disability make incredible sacrifices and carry tremendous workloads in the name of love.","705",NA
"For these families, making sure a loved one with a disability is financially secure is a real concern.","705",NA
"We have a responsibility to help ensure that their kids lead lives as fulfilling as any other Canadian.","705",NA
"That's why, in 2008, thanks to the vision of the late Jim Flaherty, our Conservative Government established Registered Disability Savings Plans.","705",NA
"These plans allow the families of children with disabilities, and those children themselves as they grow up, to set aside money for the future in a place where it can grow with them, tax-free, until it's needed.","705",NA
"Canadians have opened nearly 105,000 of these accounts since then – and through the Canada Disability Savings Grant and the Canada Disability Savings Bond programs, we've added more than $1 billion to their savings.","705",NA
"But we can do more.","705",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase the maximum annual grant for low- and middle-income families from $3,500 to $4,000.","504",NA
"This means that these families will now receive a matching grant of $4 for every $1 contributed, on the first $500 they contribute each year.","504",NA
"We'll also continue to work with the provinces and Canada's financial institutions to improve the administration of the RDSP program,","303",NA
"and to expand the range of investment options for RDSP holders.","504",NA
"We'll take these additional steps because when your loved one's future is financially secure, you're better able to focus on the important things that matter in the present.","705",NA
"This measure builds on our record of helping Canadians with disabilities fulfill their potential.","705",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support our three-year partnership with the Canadian Association of Community Living to help connect people with developmental disabilities with jobs.","705",NA
"We'll also continue our four-year partnership with the Sinneave Family Foundation and Autism Speaks Canada to expand vocational training programs for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder.","411",NA

"We'll be ready to support the initiative in areas of federal jurisdiction once the development work is complete.","705",NA
"SUPPORTING EVERY FAMILY",NA,NA
"Families come in different shapes and sizes and have different needs.","706",NA
"Our Conservative Government has consistently supported all families – we think that's real fairness.","706",NA
"This support includes adoptive families.","706",NA
"About 3,000 children are adopted in Canada every year but, at any given time, there are about 30,000 children within this country alone in need of stable homes filled with love,","706",NA
"and thousands of Canadian families waiting to invite them into their hearts and lives.","706",NA
"We recognize that adoption costs can be high and in some cases prohibitive for families.","706",NA
"That's why we've:   Expanded the Adoption Expense Tax Credit.","504",NA
"Extended EI parental benefits to foster parents who choose to adopt.","504",NA
"Cut backlogs and wait times for adopted children as part of our immigration reforms.","303",NA
"We'll continue to support adoptive families in giving children a loving home.","504",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase our support for these caring Canadians, by increasing the amount eligible for the Adoption Expense Tax Credit from $15,000 to $20,000 per child,","504",NA
"and by making this tax credit fully refundable.","504",NA
"The birth of a new baby is an exciting time for all involved, especially moms and dads.","706",NA
"It's also a period of tremendous change for parents as they adjust their work and home lives to the new responsibilities of parenthood.","706",NA
"Our Conservative Government wants to support parents during this critically important period.","504",NA
"Increasing job flexibility is one way to support moms and dads who want to spend as much time as possible with their babies as they grow and take their first steps.","504",NA
"Some parents also see the transition to parenthood as a good time to pursue their entrepreneurial instincts.","504",NA
"That's why a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Expand Employment Insurance maternity and parental benefits and federal leave provisions to increase flexibility for new parents and encourage those with self-employment goals.","504",NA
"New parents in federally regulated sectors will be provided with job protection to care for a baby up to 18 months of age, allowing workers to take up to 6 months of additional unpaid leave.","504",NA
"Parents can opt to receive their EI parental benefits at the full rate for up to 35 weeks,","504",NA
"or they can extend those payments at a lesser rate up to a maximum of 61 weeks.","504",NA
"When combined with other EI maternity leave, this can provide parents with a stream of income for 18 months while caring for their babies.","504",NA
"A new two-year pilot project will be established to allow parents to earn self-employment income, without impacting EI maternity or parental benefits, up to 100% of the weekly EI maximum insurable earnings threshold.","504",NA
"Women receiving EI maternity benefits will also be able to earn employment income under the Working While on Claim pilot project.","504",NA
"This is currently permitted for those receiving EI parental benefits.","504",NA
"We'll also continue to support choice in childcare and help families make whatever arrangements are right for them.","706",NA
"This is the underlying basis for our monthly Universal Child Care Benefit","504",NA
"and our other support for childcare including the Child Care Expense Deduction.","504",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will implement our plan to increase the Child Care Expense Deduction by $1,000, beginning this year.","504",NA
"This means that the maximum amount that can be claimed will increase to $8,000 from $7,000 for children under age seven, to $5,000 from $4,000 for children aged seven through 16, and to $11,000 from $10,000 for children with disabilities.","504",NA
"And, of course, we'll continue to maintain our Universal Child Care Benefit that provides monthly cheques to all parents, up to nearly $2,000 per year for children under age 6, and more than $700 per year for children aged 6 to 17.","504",NA
"Families help each other.","706",NA
"Sometimes Canadians are called upon to care for a gravely ill family member.","706",NA
"Such situations can be challenging financially, and no one should ever have to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping their job.","706",NA
"Our Conservative Government has taken several steps to help families faced with a family health crisis such as enacting the Family Caregiver Tax Credit","504",NA
"and establishing a special 35-week benefit for parents with critically ill children.","504",NA
"But there is more to be done.","504",NA
"When a family member is gravely ill and needs care, Canadians should be free to focus on caring for their loved ones without the added stress of worrying about their financial security.","504",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will carry out our plan to extend the Employment Insurance Compassionate Care Benefits period from six weeks to six months.","504",NA

"We're committed to ensuring that they are.","403",NA

"We'll:   Pass legislation that allows the Minister of Transport to issue motor-vehicle recalls and to demand that manufacturers repair defective vehicles as required,","403",NA
"as well as levy significant fines on manufacturers and importers who do not comply.","403",NA

"Continue our efforts to assess and manage the risks posed to the health of Canadian families and our environment by new or existing chemical substances.","501",NA
"This will include listing microbeads as a toxic substance under the Environmental Protection Act, effectively banning them in Canada.","501",NA
"Our Government in 2014 passed Vanessa's Law, named after the daughter of Member of Parliament Terence Young.","403",NA
"Vanessa died of a heart attack while taking a prescription drug that was later found to be unsafe for human consumption,","403",NA
"and Terence spent the next 14 years working tirelessly to ensure that this law became his daughter's legacy.","403",NA
"Vanessa's Law is historic legislation that gives the Government stronger powers to force drug recalls,","403",NA
"imposes new penalties on companies that market unsafe products,","403",NA
"requires that health risks be made clear in product labelling,","403",NA
"and requires health-care institutions to report serious reactions to prescription drugs.","403",NA
"Still, Vanessa's Law could go further.","403",NA
"For example, we should impose on health-care institutions a more comprehensive, standardized reporting regime when documenting such reactions.","303",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will move forward with making this important legislation even more effective at protecting Canadian families.","303",NA
"These measures build on our past record of standing up for consumers, including:   Supporting Canada's broadcast regulator in compelling satellite and cable companies to “unbundle” TV channels, so that Canadians no longer have to pay for channels they don't want.","403",NA
"Removing the GST from feminine hygiene products.","503",NA

"The other parties don't share our optimism, nor our faith in the sound instincts and common sense of our fellow Canadians.","305",NA
"Given the chance, the Liberals and NDP would put the financial security of Canadian families in jeopardy by:   Running large deficits and raising taxes that will leave our fragile economy exposed,","305",NA

"The two ultimately go hand-in-hand.","605",NA
"We can't have a strong economy if Canadian communities aren't safe and secure.","605",NA
"And we can't have real security if we don't have the means to pay for our law enforcement agencies or our military.","410",NA
"A strong economy, then, is the basis for our prosperity and our security.","410",NA
"We'll continue to vigorously pursue an anti-terrorism agenda that seeks to disrupt and undermine radical jihadism in cooperation with the countries who share our values.","605",NA
"In addition to Canada's military participation in the global coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,","104",NA

"In a dangerous and unstable world, we need a government that recognizes risks to Canadian interests and our security and speaks with clarity.","109",NA

"Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been a leader on a wide range of global issues","305",NA
"including standing up for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression,","101",NA
"defending Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and to defend itself,","101",NA

"This clarity and determination to act to protect our country has been at the heart of our counter-terrorism measures here at home.","605",NA
"Our Conservative Government released Canada's first Counter-terrorism Strategy in 2012, Building Resilience Against Terrorism, designed to counter domestic and international terrorism and protect Canadians and Canadian interests.","605",NA
"In 2013, the Combating Terrorism Act made it a criminal offence to leave or attempt to leave Canada for the purposes of participating in or facilitating terrorist activity.","605",NA

"prevent terrorist travel by air and the efforts of those who seek to use Canada as a recruiting ground,","605",NA
"and disrupt planned attacks on Canadian soil.","605",NA
"Sadly – and inexplicably, to most Canadians – a small number of young Canadians choose to turn their backs on our country, our values, and all the opportunities that living here brings, and travel abroad to connect with known terrorist organizations.","605",NA
"Some participate in the atrocities these groups carry out in foreign lands;","605",NA
"others seek to plot and commit similar horrors on Canadian soil.","605",NA
"Canadians expect real action on the part of the government to prevent such attacks.","605",NA
"We need to protect Canadians here by making sure the “foreign fighters” who travel to parts of the world where terrorists hold sway are not allowed, on their return to Canada, to act on the warped ideologies and deadly skills they've learned.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will introduce “Declared Areas” legislation, allowing the Minister of Foreign Affairs to identify any part of the world where terrorists are active as a “no-go” zone for Canadians without legitimate business there.","605",NA
"Travel to designated zones would become a serious offence, carrying a significant prison term,","605",NA
"and would allow Canadian authorities to arrest and detain foreign fighters upon their attempted return to Canada.","605",NA
"To counter terrorism and youth radicalization in Canada through research and education, our Government launched the Kanishka Project in 2011.","605",NA

"Treason, one of the oldest and most serious crimes on the books, has evolved since it was first codified into English law in the 14th century.","605",NA
"Originally an attack against the reigning monarch, it came to encompass turning against one's own state.","605",NA
"Now, in the 21st century we are witnessing the alarming emergence of a new form of treason.","605",NA
"“Foreign fighters” who are mostly young men, including some Canadians, abandon life in the West to join global jihadi groups abroad in their war against our country and our allies.","605",NA
"Canadians see this as a betrayal of our most deeply held values and, indeed, as an attack on all of us.","601",NA
"There is no greater crime than the betrayal of one's fellow citizens, and our laws need to reflect this.","601",NA
"Our current laws call for life in prison for anyone convicted of High Treason.","605",NA

"It seeks to destroy any and all who do not share its perverse, medieval view of the world.","104",NA
"And, with alarming clarity, it has threatened Canadians directly and specifically.","104",NA
"Last year's terrorist attacks in Canada, by killers inspired by ISIS's extremism, are a reminder that we are not immune to these threats.","104",NA
"Canadians did not invent this evil, nor did we invite its hatred, but we cannot ignore it in the hope it goes away.","104",NA
"Indeed, it was because ISIS met with little resistance at first that it was able to establish its so-called caliphate with such alarming speed.","104",NA
"It's now using that territory to launch and inspire attacks around the world; its goal is to replace civilization with savagery, and order with chaos.","104",NA
"We must not allow ISIS to hold a safe haven from which it can pursue an agenda of anarchy and violence.","104",NA
"That's why the Canadian Armed Forces, alongside like-minded allies of all faiths and nationalities, are part of a broad international coalition confronting and disrupting ISIS in the Middle East right now.","104",NA
"We're fighting the jihadists there to protect Canadians here.","104",NA
"We're also a leading contributor of support to the countless men, women, and children forced to flee ISIS's advance.","104",NA
"We don't have to choose, as some have suggested, between fighting the soldiers of ISIS and helping its victims.","104",NA
"In fact, it's imperative that we do both.","104",NA

"A re-elected Conservative Government will not cut and run, as our opponents would do.","104",NA

"This is an important part of our principled foreign policy.","107",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to stand up for those who are targeted because of their faith or gender.","107",NA
"Freedom of religion and belief, and the ability to express that freedom without fear of repercussion or repression, is a basic human right – not just here in Canada, but everywhere.","107",NA
"Our Government established the Office of Religious Freedom in 2013 to promote this belief globally,","107",NA
"and to advocate tolerance and pluralism around the world.","107",NA
"These values have made Canada great,","601",NA
"and our Government takes very seriously the work of advancing them.","601",NA
"However, a world of universal freedom of religion remains elusive, and there is much work left to do.","201",NA
"Almost 75 percent of the world's population lives in countries where religious freedom is highly restricted.","201",NA
"Currently, ISIS has carved out a so-called caliphate extending from Aleppo in Syria to near Baghdad in Iraq – and everywhere they hold sway, innocent men, women and children suffer atrocities daily because they don't share the terrorists' perverted version of Islam.","107",NA
"Christians, Yazidis, Druze, Alawites, Sunni Bedouins and Shia Ismailis all face subjugation, persecution, and, frequently, grisly execution for their beliefs.","107",NA
"Through the Office of Religious Freedom, in partnership with civil society groups and non-governmental organizations, we are able to stand up for these oppressed peoples, and for Canadian values.","107",NA
"Principle demands that we act.","107",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on our record of promoting tolerance and openness, as well as the rights of women and children worldwide, by funding a new three-year program within the Office of Religious Freedom to support persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East,","107",NA
"and to protect their places of worship and priceless artifacts at risk of destruction.","107",NA
"The ISIS reign of terror and the horrific civil war being fought in Syria have taken an immense toll on innocent civilians, creating a refugee crisis of historic proportions.","107",NA
"The Canadian Armed Forces are taking an active and robust role in the fight against ISIS,","104",NA
"but we're also committed to providing comfort and aid to suffering people facing displacement and persecution because of the ongoing violence.","107",NA
"Canada has long been a refuge for people fleeing violence and oppression, from United Empire Loyalists and fugitive slaves from the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, to Eastern Europeans and Vietnamese “boat people” fleeing communism in the 20th.","201",NA
"And in the 21st century, Canada is once again opening its doors to those in need.","201",NA
"We've pledged to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees by September 2016, and 3,000 Iraqis this year.","107",NA
"They will join the 20,000 Iraqis who have already arrived on our shores since 2009.","107",NA

"We'll also provide further humanitarian assistance through the Syria Emergency Relief Fund to match individual donations from Canadians up to $100 million.","107",NA
"Every year, millions of girls around the world – some as young as five years old – are forced into marriage.","706",NA
"This is far more than just a moral outrage; it is often a matter of life and death.","706",NA
"In the developing world, the leading cause of death among girls between the ages of 15 and 19 is complications during childbirth.","706",NA
"Forced marriage deprives girls of their right to an education,","706",NA
"and condemns them to a life of poverty and dependence.","706",NA
"And forced marriage is also a weapon of war.","201",NA
"Canadians are rightly appalled at reports of ISIS fighters taking young female prisoners as “brides,”","201",NA
"or forcing families to let them marry their daughters in exchange for protection from further ISIS depravities.","201",NA
"Canada has been a leader in improving maternal, newborn and child health,","107",NA
"and protecting women and girls is a key component of our foreign development goals.","107",NA
"It's also in keeping with Canadian values, which we hold to be universal.","201",NA
"Forced marriage is unacceptable in Canada,","201",NA
"and we've taken action to prevent it from occurring on our soil.","201",NA
"But it's equally unacceptable anywhere else in the world, no matter what the misguided advocates of “cultural sensitivity” might suggest.","201",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will take further action to support the victims of child, early, and forced marriage, particularly in the “rape camps” and slave markets of Iraq and Syria,","107",NA
"by establishing a new program within the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development to fund efforts to combat these practices.","107",NA
"Improving the health of mothers, newborns, and children around the world has been Stephen Harper's top development priority.","107",NA
"The Prime Minister has been leading the world on this important initiative.","305",NA
"And there's been progress: thanks to Canadian leadership and global action, maternal mortality rates are declining and millions more children are celebrating their fifth birthday.","107",NA
"Yet there's more work to be done.","107",NA
"That's why our Government has pledged significant resources to maternal, newborn, and child health from 2015 to 2020.","107",NA
"We'll continue to rally world leaders to follow Canada's lead in improving women's and children's health in developing countries.","107",NA
"CYBER SECURITY",NA,NA
"Advances in technology have led to vast improvements in our standard of living,","411",NA
"but they have also led to our greater dependence on a digital infrastructure that underlies everything from our communications networks to our financial systems to our electrical grid.","411",NA
"And this dependence makes us vulnerable to attacks that could compromise our day-to day living, our personal safety, our economy, and even our national security.","605",NA
"The threat of cybercrime is one with serious consequences for Canadians and our economy.","605",NA
"Our Conservative Government has been focused on strengthening our cyber security to protect Canadians.","605",NA
"Since 2010, our national cyber security strategy has been based on three pillars:   Securing government systems.","605",NA
"Partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside the federal government","605",NA
"And helping individual Canadians and their families enjoy increased online security.","605",NA
"In Economic Action Plan 2015, we announced significant funding to protect our vital cyber systems, including establishing a dedicated RCMP team to investigate cybercrime.","605",NA
"Still, there's more to be done.","605",NA
"Our cyber systems can be targets for foreign military and intelligence services and criminal and terrorist networks.","605",NA
"As more and more Canadians rely on the internet for business and sales, we must ensure that we're protected from cyber-attacks and cybercrimes.","605",NA
"We've proposed legislation that will require operators of vital cyber systems to implement robust cybersecurity plans that meet established standards,","605",NA
"and to report cybersecurity breaches to the federal government.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will enshrine this in law by passing the Protection of Canada's Vital Cyber Systems Act when Parliament resumes.","605",NA
"SUPPORTING UKRAINE",NA,NA

"nor his continued proxy war in other parts of eastern Ukraine.","101",NA
"The people of Ukraine have left no room for doubt: The future they desire lies to the West, with all the freedoms, opportunities and prosperity that brings.","101",NA
"We, along with our allies in NATO, support them without reservation,","101",NA
"and we stand together in Central and Eastern Europe as a bulwark against the instability Vladimir Putin promotes with his reckless provocations.","101",NA
"With the rest of the Western world, Canadians celebrated the end of the Cold War and the years of peace that followed.","106",NA
"But Vladimir Putin wants to turn back the clock; he wants Russia to bask in the perceived glories of its past, in order to disguise his failures of leadership in the present.","106",NA
"We look forward to the day when Russia returns to the community of nations –","106",NA
"but until then, Vladimir Putin's belligerence must be met with resolve and real consequences.","106",NA
"Under our Conservative Government, Canada has been a leading voice on the world stage in this regard, both in speaking out against Vladimir Putin's unprovoked aggression and in putting pressure on Russia through tough and meaningful sanctions.","106",NA
"Such sanctions are a key tool in our Government's foreign policy, having proven effective against Iran and North Korea, as well as Russia.","106",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will toughen Canada's sanctions regime by:   Adding “gross human rights violations” as a new ground for sanctions.","106",NA
"And closing loopholes that allow sanctioned individuals to circumvent travel restrictions.","106",NA
"These measures will reinforce our support for the Ukrainian people in their struggle for freedom,","101",NA
"as well as strengthen our ability to respond to international crises,","101",NA
"and align our sanctions regime with our broader values.","101",NA
"They'll also reinforce our commitment to standing up for freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law abroad.","201",NA
"To make sure our sanctions continue to be properly targeted, and properly implemented, we need to better track the flow of Russian capital through global markets – in particular capital connected to Russian state-owned enterprises and individuals already under sanction.","106",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will establish a financial task force of foreign policy experts and financial analysts to perform this task, ensuring that our sanctions regime maintains its rigor and limits Russian influence in the global economy.","106",NA
"But our support for Ukraine extends far beyond sanctions.","104",NA
"Canada has contributed both Canadian Armed Forces personnel and much-needed equipment to assist the Ukrainian military in its fight to maintain Ukraine's sovereignty.","104",NA
"We're:   Deploying CAF personnel to western Ukraine to develop and deliver training programs for their Ukrainian counterparts.","104",NA

"The measures we have taken to date are robust and meaningful, but there is more we can do.","104",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will enter into a defence co-operation agreement with Ukraine.","104",NA
"We'll also add Ukraine to the list of eligible countries for Canadian military and defence exports.","101",NA
"Our Government, as part of our principled foreign policy, has long been a leader in promoting free expression and human rights around the world, and in speaking out against dictatorships for their cruel and undemocratic actions.","201",NA
"The digital world is one more battlefield in that struggle.","201",NA
"Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and illegal occupation of Ukraine has been accompanied by a remarkable propaganda push by Moscow.","106",NA
"Russia has used the internet and other media to manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation and falsehoods.","106",NA
"By spreading half-truths, rumours and outright lies, the Kremlin not only confuses opponents but also sows unwitting and uninformed support for its cause.","106",NA
"Canada can do more to help Ukraine push back against Russian propaganda.","101",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will establish a Digital Freedom Fund to support international groups and independent media using digital tools to advance the causes of freedom and democracy around the world.","106",NA

"This support includes an $11.8 billion, ten-year increase to the Department of National Defence's budget to ensure that Canada can continue to field a combat-ready military to serve at home and abroad.","104",NA
"Missions abroad sometimes fall to Canada's Special Operations Forces, who have the agility and adaptability to tackle any challenge, anywhere in the world.","104",NA
"When duty calls, the CAF is always there for us and our allies, and our Special Operations Forces are the sharp end of the spear","104",NA
"Right now, members of the Special Operations Forces are in Iraq, training and advising Kurdish Iraqi forces in the fight against the so-called Islamic State – confronting them there, to protect Canadians here at home.","104",NA

"To help the Special Operations Forces maintain their top operational capacity, a re-elected Conservative Government will expand their size, bolstering their ranks by nearly 35 percent by 2022.","104",NA
"The military reserves have a long and proud history in Canada, dating to before the War of 1812, serving with distinction in every conflict in which Canada has been involved.","104",NA
"When the Primary Reserve and the Supplementary Reserve are combined with the Canadian Rangers and Cadet organizations across the country, Canada has 24,000 men and women ready, willing and able to answer their country's call.","104",NA

"Reservists accounted for one in four of our men and women who served in Afghanistan, and some have already served in our mission against ISIS in Iraq","104",NA

"That's why our Government is replacing the Rangers' Lee-Enfields with new rifles over the next four years.","104",NA
"The Lee Enfield has taken on iconic status, a proud symbol of both Canada's distinguished military history and our sovereignty over the Arctic – much like the Rangers themselves.","104",NA

"Prime Minister Harper's principled foreign policy also means that Canada walks tall in the world and stands up for what's right and just.","305",NA
"The Liberals and NDP would take the country down a much different and more dangerous path.","305",NA
"They would undermine Canada's security by:   Taking away the tools that we have granted our law enforcement agencies to protect Canadians from terrorist threats.","305",NA

"Expand our National Anti-Drug Strategy","605",NA
"Crack down on criminal gangs","605",NA
"Protect seniors from financial fraud","605",NA
"For too long, Canada's system of justice had its priorities backwards: it focused on the so-called “rights” and concerns of criminals, while victims and their families were left on the outside looking in.","605",NA
"We've worked hard to reverse that, in particular by bringing into force our ground-breaking Victims Bill of Rights.","605",NA
"Now victims and their families are back where they belong – at the heart of our justice system.","605",NA
"Never before has a government made victims' concerns such a priority.","605",NA
"Add to that a substantial list of other measures from our ambitious law-and-order agenda – to protect our children from predators and drug dealers,","605",NA
"to keep dangerous criminals behind bars and off our streets,","605",NA
"and to keep illegal guns, gangs, and drugs out of our communities – and it's no wonder that the crime rate is going down.","605",NA
"Justice is a fundamental Canadian value, and Canadians expect it to be administered fully, fairly, honestly and transparently.","605",NA
"So do we.","605",NA
"But the Liberals and NDP don't.","305",NA
"Justin Trudeau's only criminal justice priority is to change the law to allow the sale of marijuana in corner stores, making it more accessible to our children.","305",NA
"And the NDP has a dangerous, ideology-driven criminal justice policy that puts the so-called “rights” of criminals ahead of the rights of victims.","305",NA
"The soft-on-crime NDP have consistently opposed serious penalties for dangerous offenders.","305",NA
"Canadians can count on our Conservative Government to put their security first.","605",NA
"We share the common-sense beliefs of law-abiding Canadians, and we will continue pursuing new measures to crack down on criminals and support victims.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to make safe streets and communities a top priority.","605",NA
"NATIONAL ANTI-DRUG STRATEGY",NA,NA
"One vitally important part of keeping our streets and communities safe is keeping them free from drugs, and from the organized gangs that prey on addicts and profit from drug abuse.","605",NA
"Our Conservative Government's National Anti- Drug Strategy set out to reverse years of inaction by previous governments – indeed, in some cases, years of making the problem worse.","605",NA
"We've taken a three-pronged approach, focusing on prevention, treatment, and enforcement.","605",NA
"To this effect we've:   Toughened penalties for serious drug producers and dealers,","605",NA
"including mandatory minimum prison sentences for some offences.","605",NA
"Introduced legislation to reduce drug trafficking and abuse in our prisons.","605",NA
"Increased the resources for law-enforcement and justice officials to investigate drug crimes and prosecute offenders.","605",NA
"Worked hard to raise awareness, especially among young Canadians, of the dangers of drug use.","605",NA
"And provided significant support for treatment, to help people who've fallen prey to addiction.","605",NA
"We renewed funding for the National Anti- Drug Strategy in 2012, and in 2014 expanded the Strategy's focus to include the abuse of prescription drugs.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on this record by expanding the National Anti-Drug Strategy to:   Create a national toll-free help line to provide parents with advice and guidance,","605",NA
"including how to recognize the signs of drug use and how to prevent their children from using drugs in the first place.","605",NA
"And increase funding to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Clandestine Laboratory Teams, which investigate drug labs and target organized crime.","605",NA
"There is evidence of a strong link between mental illness and drug use: 30 percent of people diagnosed with a mental disorder also have a history of substance abuse at some point in their lives.","504",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will ask the Mental Health Commission of Canada, as part of its new, 10-year mandate announced in Economic Action Plan 2015, to work with the Canadian Centre for Substance Abuse to further integrate initiatives involving mental health and substance abuse.","504",NA
"Mental illness is a challenge that touches the lives of millions of Canadians.","504",NA
"One in five will feel its effects in any given year; one in three will experience it at some point in their lifetime.","504",NA
"The effect on Canada's economy has been estimated at close to $50 billion a year.","504",NA
"The cost to individuals and families can only be measured in heartache and despair.","504",NA
"That's why, in 2007, our Government established the Mental Health Commission, with a broad 10- year mandate to improve Canada's mental health system,","504",NA
"and to increase awareness of mental health issues, and it's why we are committed to renewing that mandate in 2017.","504",NA
"Along with a new focus on the intersection of drug abuse and mental health, a re-elected Conservative Government will set out other priorities for the Commission.","504",NA
"Nearly 4,000 Canadians take their own lives every year.","504",NA
"Suicide is the second-most common cause of death among teens, and the leading cause of death among Aboriginal Canadians under the age of 44.","504",NA

"TARGETING CRIMINAL GANGS",NA,NA
"Youth gang crime is a serious concern across the country.","605",NA
"It poses an obvious danger to law-abiding Canadians, but the damage is even further-reaching.","605",NA
"Young Canadians who get involved in criminal gangs risk seeing the recklessness of youth become a wasted adulthood in our prison system, if they survive at all.","605",NA
"Our Conservative Government has been clear: Our first priority is the safety and security of our streets and communities, and anyone who puts that in jeopardy must face the full force of the law.","605",NA
"To this effect, we've established an extensive legislative record targeting youth gangs, and organized crime more generally.","605",NA
"We've legislated mandatory minimum penalties for gang-related drug crimes and offences involving firearms.","605",NA
"We've amended the Criminal Code so that all murders connected to organized crime are automatically first-degree murders,","605",NA
"and we've created a new offence targeting the reckless criminal use of firearms, in particular drive-by shootings.","605",NA
"And we've passed a law establishing tougher penalties for criminal gang recruitment.","605",NA
"It's a criminal offence to belong to a gang and to participate in gang activities.","605",NA
"But there's no established list of gangs in Canada, meaning the existence of particular gang as a criminal organization must be proven anew in every case.","605",NA
"Parliamentary committees have recommended that we establish a gang listing system – similar to the way we deal with terrorist groups – and the Government of Manitoba has recently listed the Hells Angels as a criminal organization.","605",NA
"We think this idea has merit.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will establish a criminal gang listing process to help crack down on gangs and speed up the justice system.","605",NA
"We are also working hard to prevent young people from joining gangs in the first place.","605",NA
"In 2006 we launched the Youth Gang Prevention Fund, to support organizations that intervene directly with at-risk youth.","605",NA
"These organizations steer youth away from joining gangs or, in some cases, support them as they get out.","605",NA
"The funds from this program, which we made permanent in 2011, are put to a wide range of uses, from renting space and training staff to mentoring, counselling and skills development, and more.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase resources to the Youth Gang Prevention Fund by 25 percent, to allow it to help even more young people avoid a life of crime.","605",NA
"PROTECTING SENIORS FROM FRAUD",NA,NA
"The email says they've won the lottery – but they need to pay a processing fee up front to collect their winnings.","605",NA
"That new friend they met over social media, who eases their loneliness, would love to visit in person – but needs money to buy a plane ticket.","605",NA
"The voice on the phone claims to be a grandchild who's hit a rough spot while backpacking in Europe and needs cash in a hurry.","605",NA
"The number of tricks con artists have used to separate seniors from their hard-earned savings is bewildering and distressing.","605",NA
"And when you combine scams like these with other types of fraud – from business swindles to identity theft – Canadians lose an astonishing $10 billion to $30 billion to fraudsters every year.","605",NA
"The RCMP, in co-operation with the Competition Bureau and the Ontario Provincial Police, funds the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre to combat these types of crime.","605",NA
"But as technology becomes more sophisticated, it also becomes more and more challenging to keep on top of the problem.","605",NA
"To combat fraudsters who target Canadians, a re-elected Conservative Government will provide more resources to the Canadian Anti- Fraud Centre to bolster its intelligence and disruption activities, in particular online fraud targeting Canadian seniors.","605",NA
"We'll also toughen the punishment for con artists who steal money from Canadians.","605",NA
"In 2011, our Government passed the Standing Up for Victims of White Collar Crime Act, which imposes a mandatory minimum prison sentence of two years for criminals who commit fraud involving more than $1 million.","605",NA
"It also instructs judges to consider restitution when handing down a sentence.","605",NA
"In 2013, we passed the Protecting Canada's Seniors Act, which makes the age of the victim or victims an aggravating factor at sentencing time.","605",NA
"But jail time for the perpetrator doesn't make the victims financially whole again.","605",NA
"The most important thing to them is that they get their money back.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will amend the Criminal Code to make any financial fraud over $5,000, with multiple victims, carry a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison, unless the offender makes full and complete restitution to his or her victims.","605",NA
"LIFE MEANS LIFE AND OTHER JUSTICE PRIORITIES",NA,NA
"Like most Canadians, we hope for the successful rehabilitation of people who have fallen into a life of crime.","605",NA
"But our first priority is the safety and security of Canadians and the communities where we live, work, and raise our children.","605",NA
"There are some criminals so dangerous that, once imprisoned, they must never again walk the streets among us.","605",NA
"Currently, a life sentence – even for the most violent killers – comes with the chance of parole after 25 years.","605",NA
"When these criminals are given the opportunity for parole, Canadians' faith in our justice system is shaken,","605",NA
"and the families of victims are forced to relive the horror of their loss all over again.","605",NA
"Our proposed Bill C-53, the Life Means Life Act, will ensure that offenders who are convicted of the most heinous murders or those who are convicted of high treason will be imprisoned for the rest of their natural lives with no access to parole.","605",NA
"This includes murders involving sexual assault, kidnapping, terrorism, the killing of police officers or corrections officers, or any first degree murder of a particularly brutal nature.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will make passing the Life Means Life Act its top criminal justice priority when Parliament resumes this fall.","605",NA
"And while reintroducing and passing the Life Means Life Act is our top justice priority, it is just one of several measures our Government is proposing to further protect the safety of Canadians and the security of our communities:","605",NA
"The Dangerous and Impaired Driving Act will reflect the gravity of this offence in the minds of most Canadians,","605",NA
"and make the letter of the law match its spirit by limiting the use of technical defences in impaired driving cases and simplifying proof of blood alcohol concentration.","605",NA
"It will also make the punishment match the severity of the crime for a wide range of transportation-related offences, including increased penalties for drunk drivers.","605",NA
"The Removal of Serious Foreign Criminals Act will make it easier and faster to deport dangerous foreign nationals who commit serious crimes in Canada;","605",NA
"to transfer these foreign criminals back to their home countries;","605",NA
"and will make foreign criminals ineligible for a pardon.","605",NA
"The Penalties for the Criminal Possession of Firearms Act will restore mandatory minimum penalties for the illegal possession of a loaded prohibited or restricted firearm, such as fully automatic weapons, sawed-off rifles, or handguns, for the purpose of committing a serious offence or in a place where there is a real risk of harm to innocent bystanders.","605",NA
"This will apply the full force of the law to offenders who engage in serious criminal behavior while exempting law-abiding gun owners who store their weapons legally.","605",NA
"The Protection of Communities from the Evolving Dangerous Drug Trade Act will allow the Government to respond quickly and effectively to the emergence of new illicit substances appearing on Canadian streets;","605",NA
"broaden existing criminal laws related to the possession, production, or sale of substances or equipment intended to produce illegal controlled substances;","605",NA
"and enhance the inspection, monitoring, and regulation of legal controlled substances to prevent their diversion for illegal ends.","605",NA
"The Victims Rights in the Military Justice System Act builds on our historic Victims Bill of Rights by ensuring that victims of service offences within the military justice system have the same rights as are contained in the civilian Victims Bill of Rights.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will reintroduce these measures in Parliament and make sure they become the law of the land.","605",NA
"And we'll continue to do more to protect Canadians, including taking new action to address the problem of habitual, chronic offenders.","605",NA
"In addition, we'll build on our record of ensuring offender accountability and the principle of earned parole.","605",NA
"We're committed to helping most inmates in Canadian prisons prepare for successful reintegration into society after their release by offering opportunities for vocational training.","504",NA
"For those offenders who show that they're ready for reintegration we'll help provide marketable skills prior to release that encourage rehabilitation and lessen the chance that they'll re-offend.","504",NA
"Since 2012, a partnership between Correctional Services Canada and Habitat for Humanity has been a success on both fronts.","504",NA
"More than 350 inmates have volunteered to work on more than 20 housing projects, ranging from work on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities to full construction of pre-fabricated homes.","504",NA
"Encouraged by these results, a re-elected Conservative Government will expand the partnership between Correctional Services Canada and Habitat for Humanity, doubling the number of projects over the next four years.","504",NA
"PROTECTING CANADIANS AND SUPPORTING VICTIMS",NA,NA
"Our Conservative government has done more than any previous government in Canadian history to protect children and support victims of crime.","605",NA
"Upon taking office in 2006, we inherited a system that was concerned more with criminals than with victims.","605",NA
"It had to change.","605",NA
"And that's what we've been doing.","605",NA
"Some of our concrete steps to protect children include:   Supporting Child Advocacy Centres and Child and Youth Advocacy Centres to coordinate the investigation, prosecution and treatment of child abuse and to help child victims with counselling and other services.","605",NA
"Passing the Tougher Penalties for Child Predators Act to combat child sexual exploitation.","605",NA
"Bringing in the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act to protect Canadians, and in particular youth, from online exploitation and cyberbullying.","605",NA
"Increasing penalties for sexual offences against children and creating two new offences aimed at conduct that could facilitate or enable a sexual offence against a child.","605",NA
"Strengthening the sex offender registry.","605",NA
"And investing $14.2 million a year to protect children from predators through the National Strategy for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation on the Internet.","605",NA
"But we can do more by working with victims' advocates such as Sheldon Kennedy to protect children and help those who have been victimized by crime.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will double funding for Child Advocacy Centres and Child and Youth Advocacy Centres,","504",NA
"and will dedicate resources to help existing Centres provide satellite services to communities outside of urban centres and those without a Centre.","504",NA
"We'll also set aside funding for research into the “invisible” economic and social damage inflicted upon victims of crime.","504",NA
"These investments in front-line support for victims and children will help those who have been impacted by crime and ensure that they have the support and assistance they need.","504",NA
"High-profile cases of human trafficking and cyber and sexual violence against women and girls are reminders that we must ensure that Canada is safe for all Canadians.","605",NA
"Our Conservative Government has a strong record of protecting Canada's women and girls from violence and providing support for those affected by it.","504",NA
"This includes:   Making a $100 million, 10-year investment to prevent, detect, and combat family violence and child abuse.","504",NA
"Launching the Action Plan to Address Family Violence and Violent Crimes Against Aboriginal Women and Girls.","504",NA
"Strengthening our justice system by passing the Protecting Victims from Sex Offenders Act, to protect all Canadians, including women, from repeat, violent or sexual offenders,","605",NA
"and the Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act, which aims to protect girls and young women from early and forced marriage.","605",NA
"Nearly doubling support to end violence against women and girls, through community-based projects as part of the Women's Program under Status of Women Canada.","504",NA
"These concrete, practical steps are helping to protect women and girls so that they can pursue their dreams and opportunities.","706",NA
"But unfortunately there's more work to be done.","706",NA
"Human trafficking is a global blight that ensnares an estimated two million people every year – with some estimates putting the number of victims, mostly women and children, at as many as 15,000.","605",NA
"Frequently, victims are drawn into forced labour or prostitution.","605",NA
"This terrible crime is an affront to Canadian values, stripping from its victims their freedom, their basic rights, and their human dignity, most often under threat of violence or death.","605",NA
"Our Conservative Government has worked closely with law enforcement officials, civil society organizations, and community and religious groups to combat human trafficking.","605",NA
"We've passed legislation to restrict significantly the sex trade in Canada, including the scourge of child prostitution.","605",NA
"We've established mandatory minimum prison sentences for child trafficking.","605",NA
"We've raised the age of consent from 14 to 16.","605",NA
"And we've provided substantial funding for the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, which co-ordinates and supports efforts to bring traffickers to justice and to provide comfort and assistance to their victims.","605",NA
"But we can – and we will – do more.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will:   Renew the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking when it reaches the end of its current mandate in 2016.","605",NA
"Increase funding to efforts to help women escape the sex trade.","504",NA
"Establish February 22 as Canada's “Anti- Human Trafficking Day” – the anniversary of the unanimous decision by Parliament in 2007 to condemn all forms of human trafficking and slavery.","201",NA

"In Canada, men and women are equal under the law.","201",NA
"It's one of the values that makes Canada a land of opportunity and prosperity, a country that attracts countless immigrants from all around the world.","601",NA
"Sadly, there are some newcomers who embrace the promise of Canada, but not those values that make this country great, and who import certain brutal practices – most often affecting women and girls – that have no place here, or anywhere.","608",NA
"The tragic truth is that certain practices, such as female genital mutilation, so-called honour killings, polygamy, and early and forced marriages, are taking place within some cultural communities in Canada.","608",NA
"That's why our Government was proud to pass legislation that enshrines our aversion to these practices, and gives law-enforcement officials the power to prevent many of them from occurring on Canadian soil.","605",NA
"But these cruelties too often are carried out in the shadows, out of sight of the authorities.","605",NA
"And members of Canada's cultural communities who expose these practices risk ostracism, or worse, as a result of coming forward.","605",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will establish a tip line allowing Canadians to alert the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to suspected cases of female genital mutilation, so-called honour killings, polygamy, and early and forced marriages.","605",NA
"And we'll mandate the integrated teams of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Vancouver to investigate these cases.","605",NA
"AT RISK",NA,NA
"Our Conservative Government is committed to keeping Canada's streets and communities safe for Canadians and their families.","305",NA
"Since 2006, we've introduced and passed over 60 substantive pieces of legislation to help keep criminals behind bars, protect children, put the rights of victims ahead of criminals, and crack down on drugs, guns, and gangs.","605",NA
"The result is that our streets are safer, our children are better protected, and victims are where they belong – at the center of our criminal justice system.","605",NA
"The Liberals and NDP don't share our vision.","305",NA
"They make excuses for criminals and think incarceration – for public safety reasons, or even as punishment – is rarely warranted.","305",NA
"The Liberals' top justice priority is to change the law to allow the sale of marijuana in our corner stores, making it more accessible to our children.","305",NA
"Given the chance, the Liberals and NDP would:   Get rid of mandatory minimum penalties for violent repeat offenders.","305",NA
"Stop our Life Means Life Act to remove the possibility of parole for the most brutal and violent criminals.","305",NA

"NEW BUILDING CANADA PLAN",NA,NA
"You've been hearing a lot of talk about infrastructure spending lately – but it's a conversation our Conservative Government has been leading for years.","411",NA
"Everybody else is finally catching up, in recognition of the fact that good infrastructure is vital to our country, our communities, and our day-to-day quality of life.","411",NA
"What was true at the time of Confederation remains true today: ambitious investment in infrastructure is key to protecting our economy and moving it forward.","411",NA
"Investing in infrastructure is about more than roads and bridges, ports and public transit, or water treatment facilities and community recreation centres.","411",NA
"It's about building healthy and prosperous communities.","410",NA
"It's about making it easier for hardworking Canadians to get to work, to do business, and then to get home to their families again.","410",NA
"And it's about creating countless good jobs.","410",NA
"But while the other parties are talking, our Government has been acting.","305",NA
"We took the federal Gas Tax Fund, doubled it, indexed it, and made it permanent.","411",NA
"We established the Building Canada Plan,","411",NA
"and expanded and extended it into the New Building Canada Plan.","411",NA
"Combine all this with spending on federal infrastructure and the Public Transit Fund announced in Economic Action Plan 2015, and our investments in public infrastructure are unprecedented in Canadian history and are three times higher than under any previous federal government.","411",NA
"In fact, Canada has led the G-7 in infrastructure investments since our Conservative Government took office.","411",NA
"And we're positioned to invest more than $80 billion in federal, provincial and municipal infrastructure over the next 10 years.","411",NA
"As a result of our investments in infrastructure, we have brought the average age of Canada's core public infrastructure down from a peak of 17 years in 2001 to an estimated 14.7 years in 2013.","411",NA
"It's now lower than the historical average over the last 50 years.","411",NA
"That doesn't matter to our opponents.","305",NA
"They're telling you they'll spend even more.","305",NA
"But what they won't tell you is how they'll pay for it.","305",NA

"They'll raise your taxes.","305",NA
"Or run up debt.","305",NA
"Or both.","305",NA
"We have made historic investments in infrastructure, but we have done it without crippling our economy and hurting Canadian families.","411",NA

"And we'll continue to make these crucial, historic investments, through our ten-year, $84 billion New Building Canada Plan and federal infrastructure investments to support community infrastructure – without saddling our grandchildren with the bills.","411",NA
"STANDING UP FOR CANADA'S VETERANS",NA,NA
"The men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces do us proud, day in and day out, and they deserve all the gratitude and support we can give them.","706",NA
"But that doesn't end when they leave military service.","706",NA
"Every Canadian veteran deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.","504",NA
"As the needs of our veterans evolve, so must our response to those needs – whether it's helping them transition back to civilian life and work, or navigate the health care system.","504",NA
"Veterans risked all to give us the peaceful, prosperous country we enjoy today, and that's a debt we can never begin to repay.","504",NA
"That's why our Conservative Government has made significant improvements to the New Veterans Charter to improve programs, benefits and services for the men and women who have worn our military's uniform so proudly.","504",NA
"These improvements include:   Opening new, frontline mental health clinics across the country.","504",NA
"A new Retirement Income Security Benefit for veterans over the age of 65.","504",NA
"A new Family Caregiver Relief Benefit.","504",NA
"A new Critical Injury Benefit.","504",NA

"Hiring new case managers and new employees to improve processing times.","303",NA
"In fact, we've increased the amount spent per veteran by 35 percent – and we'll continue to make investments to improve frontline service for Canadian veterans.","504",NA
"We've also provided more assistance to veterans making the transition to civilian employment,","504",NA
"and more support for those who have suffered disabilities in the course of their service to Canada.","504",NA
"But we can do more.","504",NA
"The Earnings Loss Benefit is a taxable monthly entitlement paid out to injured veterans who are either participating in a rehabilitation program or are unable to find suitable employment due to the nature of their injuries,","504",NA
"to ensure that their income remains at least 75 percent of their gross pre-release military salary.","504",NA
"There are currently 1,860 veterans receiving this benefit.","504",NA
"Any outside income earned by a veteran who cannot be suitably employed once he or she finishes a rehab program is currently clawed back dollar-for-dollar – a real disincentive for veterans who would otherwise want to take on a different kind of work.","504",NA
"This limitation deprives them of the challenge and dignity of a job and their communities of the benefit of their skills and talents.","504",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will allow veterans receiving the extended Earnings Loss Benefit to earn up to $10,000 in employment income annually without affecting their benefit.","504",NA
"The record-of-service card – the NDI 75 – is issued to members leaving or who have left the Canadian Forces with 10 or more years of service.","303",NA
"The card is proof of previous military employment and can be used as proof of service with the Department of Veterans Affairs and for companies and service providers that offer special benefits for former service members.","303",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will issue a new Canadian Veteran Card to all Canadian Armed Forces members who complete basic training.","303",NA
"This will reduce red tape for those seeking veterans services and make it easier to receive veteran benefits.","303",NA

"made it easier to donate stocks and real estate,","606",NA
"provided tax relief for volunteer firefighters and search and rescue volunteers,","606",NA
"and established the Prime Minister's Volunteer Awards to recognize Canadians who have made invaluable contributions to their communities.","606",NA
"We will continue to support voluntarism, because we know it's such a source of strength for Canada and our communities.","606",NA
"Hundreds of thousands of Canadians devote countless hours to their communities through membership in various service clubs active in Canada.","606",NA
"From the Lions to the Elks, from the Knights of Columbus to the Royal Canadian Legion, over the years these public-spirited organizations have been the backbone of big cities and small towns across the country, raising millions of dollars for worthy causes and providing services for the less fortunate here and abroad.","606",NA
"We admire their tradition of commitment to their communities, and want to encourage a new generation of Canadians to take up their banners.","606",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will allow service club members to claim their membership fees under the Charitable Donations Tax Credit to help sustain their public spiritedness from coast to coast to coast.","606",NA
"Canadians take immense pride in the fact we are a nation of immigrants, and rightly so.","601",NA
"That so many people around the world want to live here – that so many aspire to Canadian citizenship – is testament to the hard work generations of Canadians have put into building the greatest country in the world on a foundation of values that resonate all around the globe.","601",NA
"It's no surprise that one reputable study just this year declared Canada the most admired country in the world.","601",NA
"The remarkable truth of it is that one out of every five Canadians was born elsewhere.","601",NA
"Not many countries in the world can say that.","601",NA
"None of our friends and allies in the G-7 group of major industrialized nations can.","601",NA
"Many of these new Canadians maintain close ties with the lands of their birth, socially, culturally, and economically.","601",NA
"These Canadians are our greatest ambassadors in a globalized world, and Canada and their home countries are stronger and better for their efforts.","601",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will recognize these bridge-builders by establishing a new “Maple Leaf” designation to honour extraordinary Canadians who cultivate these links.","601",NA

"From our large national institutions to the smallest community historical societies, Canada's museums carry out the noble and vital task of preserving our collective past.","601",NA
"They're the guardians of our national memory, the vaults where our national stories are kept safe.","601",NA
"Meanwhile, Canadians are still making new discoveries about our history, like last year's discovery of HMS Erebus.","601",NA
"Our museums great and small, and the modern-day explorers still uncovering the secrets of our past, must have our continued support – as must the Canadian communities from coast to coast to coast planning to celebrate our history as we approach the 150th anniversary of Confederation.","601",NA
"Our Conservative Government has an ambitious plan to celebrate Canada 150.","601",NA
"We'll invest $150 million through the Canada 150 Community Infrastructure Program to support up to 1,800 projects across the country that provide community and cultural benefits to Canadians.","601",NA
"And we'll provide $210 million through the Canada 150 Fund to support community initiatives that leave a legacy for the future.","601",NA

"First elected to the House of Commons in 1940, in 1957 he became Canada's 13th Prime Minister.","601",NA

"The Canada Cultural Investment Fund, operated by the Department of Canadian Heritage, helps not-for-profit, professional arts organizations raise money to create or expand endowment funds by matching, up to a dollar for every dollar, amounts raised by private donors.","502",NA

"Our local museums play an equally important role in our communities, especially with the Canada 150 celebrations fast approaching.","601",NA
"A re-elected Conservative Government will establish a similar endowment incentive program to benefit local museums, to ensure that these vital institutions are supported now and into the future.","502",NA
"“The beauty of what this incentive is [that it] helps museums become more engaged with their community to build longstanding bonds, to encourage philanthropy. And I welcome that. In order to get the $15 million, the museums are going to have to raise $15 million.”   Canadian Museums Association, (September 6, 2015).",NA,NA
"PROMOTING ARTS AND CULTURE AND SPORT",NA,NA
"Arts and culture help define who we are as Canadians.","502",NA
"They express Canada's diversity and strengthen our national identity.","601",NA
"They're also important economic drivers in communities across the country.","410",NA
"The arts and culture sector employs over 640,000 Canadians and is worth almost $450 billion yearly to our economy.","502",NA
"Our Conservative Government has been proud to support the creation, presentation, publishing, and marketing of arts and culture.","502",NA
"In fact, we were the only G-7 country that didn't cut direct funding to artists during the recovery from the global economic recession.","502",NA
"Instead we established permanent funding for several key arts and culture programs and organizations.","502",NA
"This includes:   Making permanent federal funding for the Canada Council for the Arts.","502",NA

"And it's working.","502",NA
"Canada set a world record for gold medals at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games and we earned 217 medals at the recent Pan-Am Games in Toronto.","502",NA

"We've increased transfers to the provinces and territories for health care to historically high levels.","504",NA
"In fact, no government in Canadian history has provided more funding for health care, and it continues to grow.","504",NA

"Dramatic breakthroughs in medical testing and diagnosis mean we have unprecedented access to the information stored in our genetic code.","411",NA

"Currently, such vessels are removed by the Coast Guard or Ministry of Transportation if there is an imminent risk of environmental damage or if they are obstructing navigation.","501",NA
"But otherwise, they sit – or drift – and rot, potentially causing longer-term environmental damage,","501",NA
"endangering other craft on the waters,","605",NA

"The Liberals have even said they'd make it one of their first priorities if elected.","305",NA

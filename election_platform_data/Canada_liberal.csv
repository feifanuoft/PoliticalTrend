"PLATEFORME ÉLECTORALE PARTI LIBÉRAL DU CANADA 2015",NA,NA
"ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS",NA,NA
"A strong economy starts with a strong middle class.","408",NA
"Our plan offers real help to Canada's middle class and all those working hard to join it.","704",NA
"When our middle class has more money in their pockets to save, invest, and grow the economy, we all benefit.","704",NA
"We will give families more money to help with the high cost of raising their kids.","504",NA
"We will cancel tax breaks and benefits for the wealthy – including the Universal Child Care Benefit –","503",NA
"and introduce a new Canada Child Benefit to give Canadian families more money to raise their kids.","504",NA
"With the Canada Child Benefit, nine out of ten Canadian families will receive more than under Stephen Harper's confusing collection of child benefit programs.","305",NA
"For the typical family of four, that means an additional $2,500 in help, tax-free, every year.","305",NA
"Because the Canada Child Benefit is tax-free and tied to income, it also provides greater support to those who need help the most: single-parent families and low-income families.","503",NA
"Our plan will lift 315,000 Canadian children out of poverty.","503",NA
"Stephen Harper thinks that government should provide child support payments to millionaires.","305",NA
"We will end that unfair giveaway.","305",NA
"MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT",NA,NA
"We will give middle class Canadians a tax break, by making taxes more fair.","503",NA
"When middle class Canadians have more money in their pockets to save, invest, and grow the economy, we all benefit.","704",NA
"We will cut the middle income tax bracket to 20.5 percent from 22 percent – a seven percent reduction.","503",NA
"Canadians with taxable annual income between $44,700 and $89,401 will see their income tax rate fall.","503",NA
"This tax relief is worth up to $670 per person, per year – or $1,340 for a two-income household.","503",NA
"To pay for this tax cut, we will ask the wealthiest one percent of Canadians to give a little more.","503",NA
"We will introduce a new tax bracket of 33 percent for individuals earning more than $200,000 each year.","503",NA
"ENDING UNFAIR TAX BREAKS",NA,NA
"We will cancel income splitting and other tax breaks and benefits for the wealthy.","503",NA
"Income splitting costs the federal government $2 billion a year but delivers benefits to only a few.","503",NA
"It will not create a single job.","503",NA
"It will not give one young person an opportunity to get ahead.","503",NA
"Income splitting delivers no benefits to working parents who earn similar salaries, no benefits to single parents, and no benefits to Canadians who do not have kids.","503",NA
"All told, income splitting benefits only about 15 percent of Canadian households.","503",NA
"We will cancel Stephen Harper's tax breaks for the wealthy,","503",NA
"to give Canadian families more money to raise their children.","503",NA
"OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG CANADIANS",NA,NA
"We will invest to create more jobs and better opportunities for young Canadians.","706",NA
"After ten years under Stephen Harper, good-quality job opportunities for young Canadians are tougher and tougher to find.","305",NA
"Faced with high unemployment and underemployment, many young people have stopped looking for work altogether.","706",NA
"This is hard for both young people and their families.","706",NA
"Many parents are seeing their household debt rise and retirement savings dwindle as they struggle to support their grown children, who often return home.","706",NA
"It is time to invest in young Canadians – to help them get the work experience they will need to start their careers and contribute fully to our economy.","706",NA
"We will create 40,000 good youth jobs – including 5,000 youth green jobs – each year for the next three years, by investing $300 million more in the renewed Youth Employment Strategy.","410",NA
"We will more than double the almost 11,000 Canadians who access Skills Link each year.","411",NA
"This program helps young Canadians – including Aboriginal and disabled youth – make a more successful transition to the workplace.","411",NA
"After this initial three-year boost in funding, we will set the renewed Youth Employment Strategy 's funding level at $385 million per year – a $50 million increase from 2015/16.","411",NA
"We will invest $40 million each year to help employers create more co-op placements for students in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and business programs.","411",NA
"And to encourage companies to hire young Canadians for permanent positions, we will also offer a 12-month break on Employment Insurance premiums.","402",NA
"We will waive employer premiums for all those between the ages of 18 and 24 who are hired into a permanent position in 2016, 2017, or 2018.","402",NA
"We will also work with provinces, territories, and post-secondary institutions to develop or expand Pre-Apprenticeship Training Programs.","411",NA
"This will provide up to $10 million per year to help young Canadians gain the skills they need to enter high-demand trades.","411",NA
"We will end the rule that discriminates against new workers and those re-entering the workforce by requiring them to accumulate 910 hours of work to qualify for Employment Insurance benefits, including training support.","503",NA
"We will invest $25 million per year in a restored Youth Service Program, to give young Canadians valuable work and life experience, and provide communities with the help required for much-needed projects.","706",NA
"RETIREMENT SECURITY",NA,NA
"We will provide Canadians with a more secure retirement.","706",NA
"After a lifetime of hard work, Canadians have earned a secure and dignified retirement, but too many now wonder when – or even if – that will happen.","706",NA
"We will help Canadians realize their goal of a secure retirement.","706",NA
"That security starts with a strong and stable pension program.","504",NA
"We will work with the provinces and territories, workers, employers, and retiree organizations to enhance the Canada Pension Plan.","504",NA
"We will not end pension income splitting for seniors.","504",NA
"We will also restore the eligibility age for Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement to 65, putting an average of $13,000 into the pockets of the lowest income Canadians each year, as they become seniors.","504",NA
"We will help to lift hundreds of thousands of seniors out of poverty by increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplement for single low-income seniors by ten percent.","504",NA
"This will give one million of our most vulnerable seniors – who are often women – almost $1,000 more each year.","504",NA
"Because many seniors live on fixed incomes, we will introduce a new Seniors Price Index to make sure that Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement benefits keep up with seniors' actual rising costs.","504",NA
"We will also make the Compassionate Care Benefit more flexible and easier to access, so that those who are caring for seriously ill family members – not just family members who are at risk of death – can access six months of benefits.","504",NA
"AFFORDABLE HOUSING",NA,NA
"We will make it easier for Canadians to find an affordable place to call home.","503",NA
"Today, one in four Canadian households is paying more than it can afford for housing, and one in eight cannot find affordable housing that is safe, suitable, and well maintained.","503",NA
"When affordable housing is in short supply, Canadians feel less secure and our whole economy suffers.","503",NA
"We will renew federal leadership in housing, starting with a new, ten-year investment in social infrastructure.","504",NA
"We will prioritize investments in affordable housing and seniors' facilities,","504",NA
"build more new housing units","504",NA
"and refurbish old ones,","504",NA
"give support to municipalities to maintain rent-geared-to-income subsidies in co-ops,","504",NA
"and give communities the money they need for Housing First initiatives that help homeless Canadians find stable housing.","504",NA
"We will encourage the construction of new rental housing by removing all GST on new capital investments in affordable rental housing.","504",NA
"This will provide $125 million per year in tax incentives to grow and renovate the supply of rental housing across Canada.","504",NA
"We will modernize the existing Home Buyers' Plan to allow Canadians impacted by sudden and significant life changes to buy a house without tax penalty.","504",NA
"This will ease the burden on Canadians facing job relocation, the death of a spouse, marital breakdown, or a decision to accommodate an elderly family member.","504",NA
"We will direct the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the new Canada Infrastructure Bank to provide financing to support the construction of new, affordable rental housing for middle- and low-income Canadians.","504",NA
"We will conduct an inventory of all available federal lands and buildings that could be repurposed,","504",NA
"and make some of these lands available at low cost for affordable housing in communities where there is a pressing need.","504",NA
"We will review escalating home prices in high-priced markets, like Toronto and Vancouver,","403",NA
"and consider all policy tools that could keep home ownership within reach for more Canadians.","504",NA
"We will also immediately restore the mandatory long-form census to ensure that decisions on housing are made using the best and most up-to-date data available.","303",NA
"POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION",NA,NA
"We will make post-secondary education more affordable.","506",NA
"For too many Canadians, rising costs have made post-secondary education increasingly out of reach.","506",NA
"It is harder and harder for middle class families to save for their kids' education, while many lower-income families are not able to save at all.","506",NA
"At the same time, the federal government spends billions each year on non-refundable tax credits that offer little direct help for students when they need it.","506",NA
"We will provide direct help to students from low- and middle-income families to help them pay for their education and ensure that debt loads are manageable.","506",NA
"We will increase the maximum Canada Student Grant for low-income students to $3,000 per year for full-time students,","506",NA
"and to $1,800 per year for part-time students.","506",NA
"In addition, to help more students from middle class families qualify for Canada Student Grants, we will increase the income thresholds for eligibility, giving more Canadian students access to even larger grants.","506",NA
"This investment will be funded by cancelling the poorly targeted education and textbook tax credits.","506",NA
"The tuition tax credit will be maintained.","506",NA
"This will increase the level of non-repayable grant assistance to students by $750 million per year, rising to $850 million per year by 2019/20.","506",NA
"We will also make our student loan system more flexible.","506",NA
"We will ensure that no graduate with student loans will be required to make any repayment until they are earning an income of at least $25,000 per year.","506",NA
"This will be done by changing the income thresholds in the Repayment Assistance Plan for recent graduates.","506",NA
"The federal government will continue to pay the interest on student loans until graduates begin to earn sufficient incomes to take over their own payments and repay their own loans.","506",NA
"We will work with provinces and territories to ensure that they do not assume any additional costs,","301",NA
"and to make sure these investments go directly to students.","303",NA
"Appropriate compensation will be offered to provinces and territories that do not participate in the Canada Student Loan program.","301",NA
"We will also work collaboratively with provinces and territories","301",NA
"to improve promotion of RESPs and Canada Learning Bonds,","506",NA
"and to make registration simpler for all families.","303",NA
"We will invest $50 million in additional annual support to the Post-Secondary Student Support Program, which supports Indigenous students attending post-secondary education,","506",NA
"and will allow the program to grow in line with increasing demand.","506",NA
"A NEW HEALTH ACCORD",NA,NA
"We will make home care more available,","504",NA
"prescription drugs more affordable,","504",NA
"and mental health care more accessible.","504",NA
"Canada's publicly-funded universal health care system is a source of pride for Canadians –","601",NA
"and a source of economic security for the middle class and those working hard to join it.","706",NA
"When Canadians are in good physical and mental health, they are able to work better, be more productive, and contribute more fully to our economy while living healthier, happier lives.","706",NA
"Despite our health care system's value and importance, it has been more than a decade since a Canadian Prime Minister sat down with provincial and territorial Premiers to strengthen the program, and ensure that it can meet current needs and the challenges that come with an aging population.","301",NA
"We will restart that important conversation","301",NA
"and provide the collaborative federal leadership that has been missing during the Harper decade.","301",NA
"We will negotiate a new Health Accord with provinces and territories, including a long-term agreement on funding.","301",NA
"As an immediate commitment, we will invest $3 billion, over the next four years, to deliver more and better home care services for all Canadians.","504",NA
"This includes more access to high quality in-home caregivers,","504",NA
"financial supports for family care,","504",NA
"and, when necessary, palliative care.","504",NA
"To help families care for their loved ones at home, we will make the Employment Insurance Compassionate Care Benefit more flexible and easier to access, so that it provides help for more than just end-of-life care.","504",NA
"We will also develop a pan-Canadian collaboration on health innovation,","504",NA
"and will improve access to necessary prescription medications.","504",NA
"We will join with provincial and territorial governments to buy drugs in bulk, reducing the cost Canadian governments pay for these drugs, and making them more affordable for Canadians.","504",NA
"We will make high-quality mental health services more available to Canadians who need them, including our veterans and first responders.","504",NA
"To eliminate systemic barriers and deliver equality of opportunity to all Canadians living with disabilities, we will consult with provinces, territories, and other stakeholders to introduce a National Disabilities Act.","503",NA
"FIGHTING POVERTY",NA,NA
"We will also lift more Canadians – including children and seniors – out of poverty.","503",NA
"Poverty and inequality are not just problems for individual Canadians – all of Canada is affected.","503",NA
"For Canadians, poverty makes it more difficult to get and stay healthy, and more difficult to find and keep good work.","503",NA
"For Canada, the costs of poverty – seen in higher health care costs and greater demand for social assistance – are immense.","503",NA
"Our plan will lift Canadians out of poverty starting immediately after the next election.","504",NA
"We will introduce a new Canada Child Benefit.","504",NA
"Tax-free, tied to income and delivered monthly, this benefit provides greater support to those who need help most: single-parent families and low-income families.","504",NA
"It will lift 315,000 children out of poverty.","504",NA
"We will help to lift hundreds of thousands of seniors out of poverty by increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplement for single low-income seniors by ten percent.","504",NA
"This will give one million of our most vulnerable seniors – who are often women – almost $1,000 more each year.","504",NA
"And, as part of our new investment in social infrastructure, we will prioritize investments in affordable housing and seniors' facilities,","504",NA
"build more new housing units","504",NA
"and refurbish old ones,","504",NA
"give support to municipalities to maintain rent-geared-to-income subsidies in co-ops,","504",NA
"and give communities the money they need for Housing First initiatives that help homeless Canadians find stable housing.","504",NA
"INVESTING TO STRENGTHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS",NA,NA
"Under Stephen Harper, Canada's economy has faltered, and our middle class now finds it harder and harder to make ends meet","305",NA
"It is time for smart, strategic investments that will turn our economy around and get it growing again.","410",NA
"Our plan will deliver the services we need,","504",NA
"create jobs,","410",NA
"and restore economic security to the middle class.","410",NA
"We will invest now in the projects our country needs and the people who can build them.","410",NA
"Interest rates are at historic lows, our current infrastructure is aging rapidly, and our economy is stuck in neutral.","410",NA
"Now is the time to invest.","410",NA
"We will run modest short-term deficits of less than $10 billion in each of the next two fiscal years to fund historic investments in infrastructure and our middle class.","409",NA
"After the next two fiscal years, the deficit will decline and our investment plan will return Canada to a balanced budget in 2019.","414",NA
"PUBLIC TRANSIT",NA,NA
"We will invest in public transit to shorten commute times,","411",NA
"cut air pollution,","501",NA
"strengthen our communities,","606",NA
"and grow our economy.","410",NA
"Canadian cities have been growing at a rapid rate, but investment in public transit has not kept pace.","411",NA
"Stephen Harper's failure to invest has led to worsening traffic congestion, making it harder for families to spend time together","305",NA
"This gridlock also costs our economy billions of dollars in lost productivity each year.","305",NA
"We will get our communities moving again, by giving our provinces, territories, and municipalities the long-term, predictable federal funding they need to make transit plans a reality.","411",NA
"Over the next decade, we will quadruple federal investment in public transit, investing almost $20 billion more in transit infrastructure.","411",NA
"In communities all across Canada, transit projects are ready to go.","411",NA
"In British Columbia's Lower Mainland, for example, plans are in place to:  • increase SeaBus service to every ten minutes during morning and afternoon rushes;","411",NA
"extend rapid transit service along Broadway, currently the busiest bus corridor in North America;","411",NA
"and  • bring light rail transit to Surrey, one of the fastest growing parts of the region.","411",NA
"We will work with provinces and municipalities across the country to get projects like these done.","301",NA
"STRONGER COMMUNITIES",NA,NA
"We will strengthen our communities by investing in the things that make them good places to live.","606",NA
"Investing in our communities is not just about creating good jobs and economic growth.","410",NA
"It is also about building communities that we are proud to call home.","606",NA
"With historic new investments in social infrastructure, we will achieve both.","504",NA
"We will improve quality of life for millions of Canadians by prioritizing investment in affordable housing,","504",NA
"seniors' facilities,","504",NA
"early learning and child care,","504",NA
"and cultural and recreational infrastructure.","411",NA
"We will also work with provinces, territories, and First Nations","301",NA
"to create a new National Early Learning and Child Care Framework, to ensure that affordable, high-quality, fully inclusive child care is available to all families who need it.","504",NA
"Over the next decade, we will invest almost $20 billion more in Canada's social infrastructure.","504",NA
"Toronto's Alexandra Park is an example of an urban community where investments in social infrastructure are already building a brighter future for its residents.","504",NA
"Aging community housing is being replaced with new affordable housing,","504",NA
"new commercial spaces,","411",NA
"and new parkland","411",NA
"– all helping to grow this vibrant neighbourhood and improve the quality of life for all who call it home.","606",NA
"With a federal partner at the table, stories like the revitalization of Alexandra Park can happen in communities all across Canada.","504",NA
"GREENER COMMUNITIES",NA,NA
"We will invest in sustainable infrastructure that makes our communities safer and more resilient.","501",NA
"Responsible governments do not walk away from challenges, or pretend they do not exist.","501",NA
"We will protect our communities from the challenges of climate change and grow our economy by making significant new investments in green infrastructure.","501",NA
"This includes investments in local water and wastewater facilities;","501",NA
"clean energy;","501",NA
"climate resilient infrastructure, including flood mitigation systems;","501",NA
"and infrastructure to protect against changing weather.","501",NA
"We will boost investment in green infrastructure by nearly $6 billion over the next four years,","501",NA
"and almost $20 billion over ten years.","501",NA
"When it comes to infrastructure that will help keep Canadians safe and better prepared for emergencies, local leaders know what needs to be done.","501",NA
"What they need is a federal partner willing to invest to help build stronger, more resilient communities.","501",NA
"In St. John's, this means upgrades to its wastewater plant.","501",NA
"In Trois-Rivières, this means improving the Maples and Cardinal-Roy reservoirs,","501",NA
"and finding ways to mitigate the regular flooding of the Millette, Bettez, and Lacerte rivers.","501",NA
"In Calgary and Southern Alberta, this means investments in flood mitigation projects, to help protect local families and businesses.","501",NA
"NEW BUILDING CANADA FUND",NA,NA
"We will make the New Building Canada Fund more focused","411",NA
"and more transparent.","303",NA
"The New Building Canada Fund is an important source of infrastructure funding for Canadian communities, but it has been hit by dramatic cuts and is heavily back-loaded, with more than 70 percent of its funding locked away until after 2019.","411",NA
"We will make the New Building Canada Fund more focused.","411",NA
"By providing significant, separate investments in public transit,","411",NA
"social infrastructure,","504",NA
"and green infrastructure,","501",NA
"we will enable the New Building Canada Fund to make greater investments in Canada's roads, bridges, transportation corridors, ports, and border gateways, helping Canada's manufacturers get their goods to market.","411",NA
"We will also make the fund more transparent, by providing clearer project criteria,","304",NA
"along with faster approval processes.","303",NA
"KEEPING OUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES",NA,NA
"We will make sure that no money intended for investment in communities is allowed to lapse.","411",NA
"Too often, Stephen Harper budgeted funds for use in our communities, then let those dollars go unspent.","305",NA
"We will make sure our communities are not shortchanged.","411",NA
"Near the end of the fiscal year, we will automatically transfer any uncommitted federal infrastructure funds to municipalities, through a temporary top-up of the Gas Tax Fund.","411",NA
"This will ensure that no committed infrastructure money is allowed to lapse, but is instead always invested in our communities.","411",NA
"CANADA INFRASTRUCTURE BANK",NA,NA
"We will establish the Canadian Infrastructure Bank to provide low-cost financing for new infrastructure projects.","411",NA
"The federal government can use its strong credit rating and lending authority to make it easier and more affordable for municipalities to build the projects their communities need.","411",NA
"Where a lack of capital represents a barrier to projects, the Canada Infrastructure Bank will provide loan guarantees and small capital contributions to provinces and municipalities to ensure that the projects are built.","411",NA
"JOB AND SKILLS TRAINING",NA,NA
"We will help Canadians get the training they need to find and keep good jobs.","411",NA
"In a changing economy, Canadians need more opportunities to improve their skills and upgrade their credentials.","411",NA
"We will make it easier for adults to access training programs by increasing investment in skills training.","411",NA
"To help those receiving Employment Insurance get the training they need to rejoin the workforce, we will invest $500 million more each year in provincial and territorial Labour Market Development Agreements.","411",NA
"To help those who do not qualify for Employment Insurance or are not currently employed, we will invest an additional $200 million in training programs led by the provinces and territories.","411",NA
"We will also invest $50 million to renew and expand funding to the Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy,","411",NA
"and provide $25 million each year for training facilities, delivered in partnership with labour unions.","411",NA
"We will work with employers and workers to determine an appropriate apprenticeship ratio for all federal infrastructure projects.","411",NA
"Our total investment of an additional $775 million per year for job and skills training will help Canadians get the training they need to find and keep good jobs.","411",NA
"JOBS AND INNOVATION",NA,NA
"We will kick-start investment in innovation to grow our economy and create good, middle class jobs.","402",NA
"To get our economy growing again, we need to immediately invest in helping our businesses and entrepreneurs – including those in manufacturing – become more innovative, competitive, and successful.","402",NA
"Over the next three years, we will:  invest $200 million each year in a new Innovation Agenda to significantly expand support for incubators and accelerators, as well as the emerging national network for business innovation and cluster support;","402",NA
"and   invest an additional $100 million each year in the Industrial Research Assistance Program, which has a proven track record of helping small- and medium-sized businesses to innovate and become world leaders.","402",NA
"AGRICULTURE",NA,NA
"We will help Canada's agriculture sector be more innovative, safer, and stronger.","703",NA
"Canada's farmers and ranchers are the foundation of our food sector.","703",NA
"The work that they do to feed Canada and the world is vital, but government support is needed to help them with challenges ranging from transportation to water management to research and food safety.","703",NA
"To attract investment and create good jobs in food processing, we will invest $160 million, over four years, in an Agri-Food Value Added Investment Fund.","703",NA
"This will provide technical and marketing assistance to help food processors develop new value-added products that reflect changing tastes and market opportunities.","703",NA
"To support innovation in the agricultural sector, we will invest an additional $100 million, over four years, in agricultural research.","703",NA
"To better allocate research funding, we will establish a transparent process that involves food producers.","303",NA
"We will invest an additional $80 million, over four years, in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for more food safety inspections of domestic and imported foods.","703",NA
"We will continue to defend Canadian interests during trade negotiations, including supply management.","703",NA
"We will also work with provinces, territories, and other willing partners,","301",NA
"to better address water and soil conservation and development issues, including investments in appropriate infrastructure.","501",NA
"LABOUR UNIONS",NA,NA
"We will restore fair and balanced labour laws that acknowledge the important role of unions in Canada.","701",NA
"Labour unions play an important role in protecting the rights of workers and growing the middle class.","701",NA
"Under Stephen Harper, many of the fundamental labour rights that unions have worked so hard to secure have been rolled back, making it more difficult for workers to organize freely, bargain collectively in good faith, and work in safe environments.","305",NA
"We will restore fair and balanced labour laws that acknowledge the important role of unions in Canada,","701",NA
"and respect their importance in helping the middle class grow and prosper.","701",NA
"This begins with repealing Bills C-377 and C-525, legislation that diminishes and weakens Canada's labour movement.","701",NA
"Changes to labour laws should be based on evidence, not ideology, and made after legitimate consultation with unions.","701",NA
"We will reinstate a modernized and inclusive fair wages policy for federal procurement.","412",NA
"We are strongly committed to supporting and protecting workers' rights,","701",NA
"and as government, we will bargain in good faith with Canada's public sector unions.","701",NA
"LABOUR-SPONSORED FUNDS",NA,NA
"We will reinstate the tax credit for contributions made to labour-sponsored funds, to help support economic growth and help Canadians save for their retirement.","504",NA
"In many parts of the country, labour-sponsored funds are used to help small- and medium-sized businesses get off the ground, creating jobs and economic growth.","410",NA
"In Quebec, they also serve as an important retirement savings vehicle.","504",NA
"There, labour-sponsored funds help 650,000 workers save for retirement,","504",NA
"while investing in Canada's entrepreneurs.","410",NA
"Even though we need to do more to encourage investment in new, job-creating businesses, and more to help Canadians save for their retirement, the Harper Convervatives are phasing out the tax credit for investments in labour-sponsored funds.","305",NA
"We will immediately reinstate the tax credit in full.","504",NA
"HELP THAT WORKS FOR MODERN CANADIAN FAMILIES",NA,NA
"For most Canadians, balancing work and family life is a daily challenge.","504",NA
"As families change and adapt, so too should government.","504",NA
"It is time for programs and benefits that truly work for modern Canadian families.","504",NA
"MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR PARENTS",NA,NA
"We will make parental benefits more flexible.","504",NA
"Every family's needs are different.","504",NA
"Canadian parents deserve a parental benefits plan that is flexible and able to adjust to their unique family and work circumstances.","504",NA
"We will introduce more flexible parental benefits that will:   allow parents to receive benefits in smaller blocks of time over a period of up to 18 months;","504",NA
"and   make it possible for parents to take a longer leave – up to 18 months when combined with maternity benefits – at a lower benefit level.","504",NA
"We will work with the provinces and territories to amend their labour codes, to reflect these new federal benefits.","301",NA
"This more flexible plan will benefit more Canadians, representing an investment of $125 million per year in the economic security of Canadian families.","504",NA
"SUPPORTING CAREGIVERS",NA,NA
"We will make the compassionate care benefit easier to access, more flexible, and more inclusive.","504",NA
"Millions of Canadians provide compassionate care for seriously ill family members, but the benefits available through Employment Insurance can be difficult to access.","504",NA
"We will introduce a more flexible and inclusive benefit available to any Canadian who provides care to a seriously ill family member.","504",NA
"This expanded benefit will:  be easier to access – applicants will still be expected to submit a medical certificate in order to qualify, but the benefit will be more inclusive;","504",NA
"be more flexible – caregivers can claim the benefit in blocks of time over a year-long period, and family members can share the six months of benefits;","504",NA
"and  be more inclusive – for example, those caring for a seriously ill adult family member who needs care beyond what can be provided during evenings and weekends, or those caring for a seriously ill child who cannot attend school for an extended period of time, will no longer be excluded from the benefit.","504",NA
"This enhanced compassionate care benefit represents an investment of $190 million per year in supporting Canada's compassionate caregivers.","504",NA

"We will strengthen the Employment Insurance system to make sure that it works for our economy and for all Canadians.","504",NA
"Starting in 2017, we will reduce the waiting period for benefits.","504",NA

"CHILDCARE",NA,NA

"Child care needs vary from family to family, and provinces and territories have responded to these needs in different ways.","301",NA

"This work will begin in the first 100 days of a Liberal government","504",NA

"HELPING EDUCATORS",NA,NA
"We will introduce a new tax benefit to help teachers and early childhood educators with the cost of school supplies.","506",NA
"Teachers and early childhood educators work hard to provide a positive learning environment for our children, often paying out-of-pocket for classroom supplies.","506",NA

"To help offset these costs, we will introduce a new Teacher and Early Childhood Educator School Supply Tax Benefit.","506",NA
"This new benefit will apply to the purchase of up to $1,000 worth of school supplies each year, providing a cash benefit of up to $150 each year for licensed and certified teachers and educators, starting in the 2015 tax year.","506",NA

"Canada's North is a vast and beautiful part of the world, home to a rich culture and tremendous economic potential.","410",NA
"Because of its isolation, however, it is also a very expensive place to live.","504",NA
"The Northern Residents Deduction was designed to help mitigate these higher costs, and help attract workers to the North.","504",NA
"Unfortunately, the deduction amount has not kept pace with inflation, making its help less valuable to those who need it.","504",NA
"To help northern residents with higher costs of living, and to help our northern economies grow, we will increase the residency component of the deduction by 33 percent to a maximum of $22 per day.","504",NA
"We will also index this benefit so that it keeps pace with inflation.","504",NA
"To ensure that northern families have access to affordable, healthy food, we will increase investments in the Nutrition North program by $40 million, over four years.","504",NA
"We will also work with northern and remote communities to ensure that the program is more transparent, effective, and accountable to northerners and other Canadians.","303",NA
"As part of new, ten-year investments in social infrastructure and green infrastructure, we will prioritize investment in affordable housing","504",NA
"and climate change preparedness, both of which are important to the quality of life for northern Canadians.","501",NA

"This is both the right thing to do and a sure path to economic growth","607",NA
"We will immediately re-engage in a renewed nation-to-nation process with Indigenous Peoples to make progress on the issues most important to First Nations, the Métis Nation, and Inuit communities – issues like housing,","504",NA
"infrastructure,","411",NA
"health and mental health care,","504",NA
"community safety and policing,","605",NA
"child welfare,","504",NA
"and education.","506",NA

"Today, less than half of students on reserves graduate from high school.","506",NA
"To help close the funding gap and improve outcomes for First Nations students, we will invest new funding each year in core funding for kindergarten through grade 12 programs.","506",NA

"Veterans have proven their ability to work hard and succeed, but many find it difficult to build new careers after their years of service.","506",NA
"To help veterans re-enter the workforce, and to help expand Canada's skilled labour force, we will invest $80 million every year to create a new Veterans Education Benefit.","506",NA
"This benefit will provide full support for the costs of up to four years of college, university, or technical education for Canadian Forces veterans after completion of service.","506",NA
"We will also expand the number of job opportunities available to veterans by ensuring provisions for their employment are included in the Community Benefits Agreements of federal infrastructure projects.","706",NA
"BETTER SERVICE",NA,NA

"We will also immediately hire additional mental health professionals to give veterans the support they need.","504",NA

"For far too many Canadians – overwhelmingly women – sexual violence, sexual harassment, and intimate partner violence are real, and even daily, threats.","605",NA

"regulate,","403",NA

"Canada's current system of marijuana prohibition does not work.","604",NA
"It does not prevent young people from using marijuana and too many Canadians end up with criminal records for possessing small amounts of the drug.","604",NA
"Arresting and prosecuting these offenses is expensive for our criminal justice system.","604",NA
"It traps too many Canadians in the criminal justice system for minor, non-violent offenses.","604",NA
"At the same time, the proceeds from the illegal drug trade support organized crime and greater threats to public safety, like human trafficking and hard drugs.","604",NA

We support policies that motivate rather than demoralize our educators.,progressivism

"And we will oppose Republican plans to slash funding and block grant Medicaid and SNAP, which would harm millions of Americans.",regulationism
We will keep fighting until the ACA’s Medicaid expansion has been adopted in every state.,regulationism
Nineteen states have not yet expanded Medicaid.,regulationism

Britain has always been a great trading nation.,laissez-faire
Trade will continue to be crucial to our future growth and prosperity.,laissez-faire

"These pensions exist because employees have saved diligently through their life, often foregoing luxuries and holidays abroad.",laissez-faire
Those people did the right thing.,laissez-faire
"Business owners who abuse pension funds and put them at risk, sometimes for their own lavish enrichment, are entirely in the wrong.",regulationism
"The current powers of regulators and the Pension Protection Fund are insufficient to ensure that pension savers, pensioners and prudent company directors are protected from unscrupulous business owners.",regulationism
"A Conservative government will act to tighten the rules against such abuse,",regulationism
and increase the punishment for those caught mismanaging pension schemes.,conservatism
"We will build on existing powers to give pension schemes and the Pensions Regulator the right to scrutinise, clear with conditions or in extreme cases stop mergers, takeovers or large financial commitments that threaten the solvency of the scheme.",regulationism
"We will also give the Pensions Regulator new powers to issue punitive fines for those found to have wilfully left a pension scheme under-resourced and, if necessary, powers similar to those already held by the Insolvency Service to disqualify the company directors in question.",regulationism
We will consider introducing a new criminal offence for company directors who deliberately or recklessly put at risk the ability of a pension scheme to meet its obligations.,conservatism
Conservatives believe in the rights of business owners.,laissez-faire
"We want to be a global nation that is competitive, outward-looking and open for business",laissez-faire

We welcome overseas investment and want investors to succeed here,laissez-faire
but not when success is driven by aggressive asset- stripping or tax avoidance.,conservatism
We will update the rules that govern mergers and takeovers.,regulationism
This will require careful deliberation but we can state now that we will require bidders to be clear about their intentions from the outset of the bid process;,regulationism
that all promises and undertakings made in the course of takeover bids can be legally enforced afterwards;,regulationism
and that the government can require a bid to be paused to allow greater scrutiny.,regulationism
We shall also take action to protect our critical national infrastructure.,jianshe
We will ensure that foreign ownership of companies controlling important infrastructure does not undermine British security or essential services.,conservatism
We have already strengthened ministerial scrutiny and control in respect of civil nuclear power,regulationism
"and will take a similarly robust approach across a limited range of other sectors, such as telecoms, defence and energy.",regulationism
We believe people should be rewarded for their talents and efforts,laissez-faire
but the public is rightly affronted by the remuneration of some corporate leaders.,regulationism
"Senior corporate pay has risen far faster than corporate performance, and the gap between those paid most and those paid least has grown from 47:1 in 1998 to 128:1 in 2015.",progressivism
The next Conservative government will legislate to make executive pay packages subject to strict annual votes by shareholders,conservatism
and listed companies will have to publish the ratio of executive pay to broader UK workforce pay.,conservatism
"Companies will have to explain their pay policies, particularly complex incentive schemes, better.",conservatism
"We will commission an examination of the use of share buybacks, with a view to ensuring these cannot be used artificially to hit performance targets and inflate executive pay.",regulationism
The modern joint stock company is a British invention.,conservatism
"It works because it is rules-based, but the rules need to change as the world changes.",regulationism
"Boards should take account of the interests not just of shareholders but employees, suppliers and the wider community.",conservatism
"To ensure employees’ interests are represented at board level, we will change the law to ensure that listed companies will be required either to nominate a director from the workforce, create a formal employee advisory council or assign specific responsibility for employee representation to a designated non-executive director.",conservatism
"Subject to sensible safeguards, we will introduce, for employees, a right to request information relating to the future direction of the company.",conservatism
These strengthened arrangements will apply to publicly-listed companies.,conservatism

"Our modern industrial strategy is designed to deliver a stronger economy that works for everyone – where wealth and opportunity are spread across every community in the United Kingdom, not just the most prosperous places in London and the south east.",progressivism
"It will help young people to develop the skills they need to do the high-paid, high-skilled jobs of the future.",jianshe
"And it will back Britain for the long term: creating the conditions where successful businesses can emerge and grow, and helping them to invest in the future of our nation.",laissez-faire
"The strategy is not about picking winners, propping up failing industries, or bringing back old companies from the dead.",laissez-faire
and become homes to millions of new jobs.,progressivism
"And, because this is about meeting our economy’s long term challenges, the industrial strategy will focus on creating the right institutional framework to make the strategy last for decades to come.",regulationism
"We will spend more on research and development, to turn brilliant discoveries into practical products and transform the world’s industries – such as the batteries that will power a new generation of clean, efficient, electric vehicles.",jianshe
"We will establish funding streams to ensure investment for the long term,",jianshe
"and make a modern technical education available to everyone, throughout their lives, to provide the skills they need.",jianshe
We will remove the barriers that hold backsmallfirms withbigpotential–andletthemcompetewhengovernmentitselfisthebuyer.,laissez-faire
"We will build on the success of world-beating sectors such as car and aero manufacturing, financial services, life sciences, digital technology and our creative industries, and help other sectors develop the conditions which they need to thrive.",jianshe
"We will ensure industry and businesses have access to reliable, cheap and clean power.",jianshe
"We will deliver the infrastructure – the road, rail, airports and broadband – that businesses need.",jianshe
"Our long-term prosperity depends upon science, technology and innovation.",jianshe
The UK has an outstanding science base and many world-leading tech companies.,jianshe
We now need to go further.,jianshe
Our ambition is that the UK should be the most innovative country in the world.,jianshe
"At the last autumn statement, we announced a significant increase in government investment in research and development.",jianshe
"We will deliver this and ensure further growth so that overall, as a nation, we meet the current OECD average for investment in R&D – that is, 2.4 per cent of GDP – within ten years, with a longer-term goal of three per cent.",jianshe
We will increase the number of scientists working in the UK and enable leading scientists from around the world to work here.,jianshe
We will work hard to ensure we have a regulatory environment that encourages innovation.,jianshe
Our world-beating universities will lead the expansion of our R&D capacity.,regulationism
"We must help them make a success of their discoveries – while they have a number of growing investment funds specialising in spin-outs, we have more to do to replicate the success of similar university funds in the United States.",regulationism
"To fix that, we will work to build up the investment funds of our universities across the UK.",regulationism
"We want larger, aggregated funds to increase significantly the amounts invested in and by universities.",regulationism
"We want universities to enjoy the commercial fruits of their research, through funds that are large enough to list, thereby giving British investors a chance to share in their success.",regulationism
"If our modern industrial strategy is to succeed, it must address the UK’s slow productivity growth and it must be funded properly from the start.",jianshe
So we have launched a new £23 billion National Productivity Investment Fund.,jianshe
"The government will target this spending at areas that are critical for productivity: housing, research and development, economic infrastructure and skills.",jianshe
"This will include £740 million of digital infrastructure investment, the largestinvestmentinrailways since Victoriantimes,",jianshe
£1.1billionto improve local transport,jianshe
and £250 million in skills by the end of 2020.,jianshe
"The National Productivity Investment Fund will take total spending on housing, economic infrastructure and R&D to £170 billion during the next parliament.",jianshe
People have long talked about the need to create UK sovereign wealth funds.,regulationism
We will now make this a central part of our long-term plan for Britain.,regulationism
"We will create a number of such funds, known as Future Britain funds, which will hold in trust the investments of the British people, backing British infrastructure and the British economy.",regulationism
"We anticipate early funds being created out of revenues from shale gas extraction, dormant assets, and the receipts of sale of some public assets.",regulationism
We will encourage pension funds with an interest in joining Future Britain funds to do so.,regulationism
"As we set out in chapter three, the next Conservative government will give Britain the technical education it has lacked for decades.",jianshe
This will take time but we must also address the immediate needs of those sectors of the economy suffering shortages in skills.,jianshe
"We will make the immigration system work for these sectors,",jianshe
whilst ensuring that we develop the skills we need for the future.,jianshe
We will therefore ask the independent Migration Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the government about how the visa system can become better aligned with our modern industrial strategy.,jianshe
"We envisage that the committee’s advice will allow us to set aside significant numbers of visas for workers in strategically-important sectors, such as digital technology, without adding to net migration as a whole.",jianshe
"However, skilled immigration should not be a way for government or business to avoid their obligations to improve the skills of the British workforce.",jianshe
"So we will double the Immigration Skills Charge levied on companies employing migrant workers, to £2,000 a year by the end of the parliament,",conservatism
using the revenue generated to invest in higher level skills training for workers in the UK.,jianshe
The Conservative Party is the party of enterprise and of the entrepreneur.,laissez-faire
We understand that small businesses are the wellspring of growth.,laissez-faire
"They form a key part of British life, valued for their contribution to every community across the country.",laissez-faire
"We will continue to support small businesses through business rate relief and low taxation,",laissez-faire
and by reducing the bureaucracy and regulation that prevents small businesses from flourishing.,laissez-faire
"As part of broader reforms to the business energy market, we will consult on how to extend our safeguard tariff cap to micro-businesses.",laissez-faire
"Central government must play a role in supporting SMEs: across all government departments, we will ensure that per cent of central government purchasing will come from SMEs by the end of the parliament.",laissez-faire
"As part of our modern industrial strategy, we will explore how government can do even more to support innovation by small and start-up firms.",laissez-faire
"We also recognise that government can improve the general business environment for SMEs, so we will use our buying power to ensure that big contractors comply with the Prompt Payment Code both on government contracts and in their work with others.",laissez-faire
"If they do not do so, they will lose the right to bid for government contracts.",laissez-faire
Our modern industrial strategy is not about ‘planning’ the economy.,jianshe
"It is about helping old industries find prosperous new life and unlock future opportunities, and new industries to grow.",jianshe
Some industries have a great history.,conservatism
We believe they can have a great future too.,conservatism
"We have already demonstrated that in advanced manufacturing, such as aero and automotive engineering, we can lead the world.",jianshe
We will continue to support these key industries so that they can grow further.,jianshe
"We want to replicate that success in other sectors – like shipbuilding where, for the first time in decades, there is the prospect of a renaissance.",jianshe
"We will take forward Sir John Parker’s review of shipbuilding, helping our shipyards modernise and collaborate.",jianshe
"We want to see shipbuilding growing on the Clyde and on the Forth, in Belfast and in Barrow, and in the north-east and south of England.",jianshe
"Other industries, like the oil and gas sector, are transforming.",jianshe
The North Sea has provided more than £300 billion in tax revenue to the UK economy and supports thousands of highly-skilled jobs across Britain.,jianshe
"We will ensure that the sector continues to play a critical role in our economy and domestic energy supply, supporting further investment in the UK’s natural resources.",jianshe
We will continue to support the industry and build on the unprecedented support already provided to the oil and gas sector.,jianshe
"While there are very significant reserves still in the North Sea, it is expected to be the first major oil and gas basin in the world to decommission fully, and we will take advantage of that to support the development of a world-leading decommissioning industry.",jianshe
We will work with the industry to create a multi-use yard and the UK’s first ultra-deep water port to support this industry.,jianshe
Other industries are already highly successful.,jianshe
"Life sciences, for example, employs 175,000 people and many of the world’s top medicines have been developed in the UK.",jianshe
"We will continue to support research into the diagnosis and treatment of rare cancers and other diseases, including Genomics England’s work in decoding 100,000 genomes.",jianshe
"This, together with the development of stronger research links with the NHS, can help scientists and doctors design more effective and personalised treatments, and help maintain our position as the European hub for life sciences.",jianshe
A successful industrial strategy requires competitive and affordable energy costs.,regulationism
"We want to make sure that the cost of energy in Britain is internationally competitive, both for businesses and households.",laissez-faire
"We will therefore commission an independent review into the Cost of Energy, which will be asked to make recommendations as to how we can ensure UK energy costs are as low as possible,",regulationism
"Our ambition is that the UK should have the lowest energy costs in Europe, both for households and businesses.",regulationism
"So as we upgrade our energy infrastructure, we will do it in an affordable way, consistent with that ambition.",jianshe
"And because for British companies, an energy-efficient business is a more competitive business, we will establish an industrial energy efficiency scheme to help large companies install measures to cut their energy use and their bills.",laissez-faire
"We want to see a diverse range of sources for Britain’s energy production, because a diverse energy economy is the best way to stimulate innovation,",jianshe
and also to ensure that we are getting the right generation in the right place.,jianshe
"For instance, while we do not believe that more large-scale onshore wind power is right for England, we will maintain our position as a global leader in offshore wind and support the development of wind projects in the remote islands of Scotland, where they will directly benefit local communities.",jianshe
"Above all, we believe that energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives.",jianshe
"So, after we have left the European Union, we will form our energy policy based not on the way energy is generated but on the ends we desire – reliable and affordable energy,",jianshe
seizing the industrial opportunity that new technology presents,jianshe
The discovery and extraction of shale gas in the United States has been a revolution.,jianshe
"Gas prices have fallen, driving growth in the American economy and pushing down prices for consumers.",jianshe
The US has become less reliant on imported foreign energy and is more secure as a result.,jianshe
"We believe that shale energy has the potential to do the same thing in Britain, and could play a crucial role in rebalancing our economy.",jianshe
We will therefore develop the shale industry in Britain.,jianshe
"We will only be able to do so if we maintain public confidence in the process,",jianshe
We will legislate to change planning law for shale applications.,jianshe
"Non-fracking drilling will be treated as permitted development,",jianshe
"expert planning functions will be established to support local councils,",jianshe

"This will provide clear governance and accountability,",jianshe

Our ambition is for Britain to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and use.,jianshe
We want almost every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050 – and will invest £600 million by 2020 to help achieve it.,jianshe
"We will invest in more low-emission buses,",jianshe
as well as supporting audio-visual displays for bus passengers and community minibuses for rural areas poorly served by public transport.,jianshe
"We will focus on creating extra capacity on the railways, which will ease overcrowding, bring new lines and stations, and improve existing routes – including for freight.",jianshe
"We will increase services on our main lines and commuter routes,",jianshe
and launch new services to places which are poorly served or host major new housing projects.,jianshe
We will continue to support local authorities to expand cycle networks and upgrade facilities for cyclists at railway stations.,jianshe
We have seen welcome growth and civic renewal in some major cities.,jianshe

"We will encourage the very best practice in the design of buildings and public spaces, including a review of the design of government buildings, to ensure that when the state builds, it makes a positive contribution to a local area.",jianshe

The proportion of pupils taking core academic subjects at GCSE has almost doubled.,regulationism
There remains a long way to go.,regulationism
"For too many children, a good school remains out of reach.",regulationism
There are still 1 million children in primary and secondary schools rated by Ofsted as ’requires improvement’ or ’inadequate’.,regulationism
"If schools across the Midlands and north of England had the same average standards as those in the south, nearly 200,000 more children would be attending good schools.",regulationism
We need to give every child in our country the best possible education if we are to provide them with the best opportunities in the world.,regulationism
To achieve that ambition we will have to go further in reforming our education system.,regulationism
"So we will continue with our programme of free schools, building at least a hundred new free schools a year.",regulationism
We will prohibit councils from creating any new places in schools that have been rated either ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improvement’ by Ofsted.,regulationism
We will make it a condition for universities hoping to charge maximum tuition fees to become involved in academy sponsorship or the founding of free schools.,regulationism
We will introduce new funding arrangements so we can open a specialist maths school in every major city in England.,regulationism

"We will lift the ban on the establishment of selective schools, subject to conditions, such as allowing pupils to join at other ages as well as eleven.",regulationism
"Contrary to what some people allege, official research shows that slightly more children from ordinary, working class families attend selective schools as a percentage of the school intake compared to nonselective schools.",progressivism
"While the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils stands at 25 per cent across the country, at selective schools it falls to almost zero.",regulationism
"These changes will have a great effect, but alone they cannot overcome the unfairness of selection by house price, where ordinary, working class families find it difficult to access the best schools because they cannot afford to live in the catchment area.",progressivism

and we will bear down on unnecessary paperwork and the burden of Ofsted inspections.,regulationism
"We will create a single jobs portal, like NHS Jobs, for schools to advertise vacancies in order to reduce costs and help them find the best teachers.",regulationism
The way funding is distributed to schools in England is not fair.,regulationism
"Across the country, children with the same needs and expectations receive markedly different rates of funding for their school place.",regulationism
We have begun to correct this and in the next parliament we will make funding fairer still.,regulationism
"We appreciate that it is hard for schools receiving a higher level of funding to make cuts in order to pay for increases elsewhere, so while we will make funding fairer over the course of the parliament, we will make sure that no school has its budget cut as a result of the new formula.",regulationism
"We will increase the overall schools budget by £4 billion by 2022, representing more than a real terms increase for every year of the parliament.",regulationism
We will continue to protect the Pupil Premium to support those who need it.,regulationism
"In order to fund these commitments, we have taken an important decision.",laissez-faire
We do not believe that giving school lunches to all children free of charge for the first three years of primary school – regardless of the income of their parents – is a sensible use of public money.,laissez-faire
There is now good evidence that school breakfasts are at least as effective in helping children to make progress in school.,laissez-faire
"So under a new Conservative government, schools in England will offer a free school breakfast to every child in every year of primary school, while children from low-income families will continue to receive free school lunches throughout their years in primary and secondary education.",laissez-faire
"The savings made from this change will be added to the core schools budget, meaning that every penny saved will go towards children’s education.",regulationism
"For too long in this country, technical excellence has not been valued as highly as academic success.",jianshe

"Lastly, we will make the system easier for young people taking technical and vocational routes.",jianshe
We will introduce a UCAS-style portal for technical education.,jianshe
We will introduce significantly discounted bus and train travel for apprentices to ensure that no young person is deterred from an apprenticeship due to travel costs.,progressivism
We will in the next parliament produce the best programme of learning and training for people in work and returning to work in the developed world.,jianshe
We will help all workers seeking to develop their skills in their existing jobs by introducing a new right to request leave for training for all employees.,jianshe
"Alongside this, we will help workers to stay in secure jobs as the economy changes by introducing a national retraining scheme.",progressivism
"Under the scheme, the costs of training will be met by the government, with companies able to gain access to the Apprenticeship Levy to support wage costs during the training period.",jianshe
We will break down the barriers to public sector workers taking on more qualified roles because of their prior educational attainment.,progressivism
"For instance, we will ensure that teaching assistants can become qualified teachers and healthcare assistants can become nurses via a degree apprenticeship route, in addition to other routes.",jianshe
"We will equip people with the digital skills they need now, and in the future, by introducing a right to lifelong learning in digital skills, just as we have done for literacy and numeracy.",jianshe
Employment is at a record high and we will continue to strive for full employment.,progressivism
"We will continue to run the welfare system in accordance with our belief that work is the best route out of poverty,",laissez-faire
"that work should always pay,",progressivism
and that the system should be fair both to the people in need of support and those who pay for it.,progressivism
"We have no plans for further radical welfare reform in this parliament and will continue the roll-out of Universal Credit, to ensure that it always pays to be in work.",regulationism
"We will also work to help those groups who have in the past found it difficult to get employment, by incentivising employers to take them on.",progressivism
"So for businesses employing former wards of the care system, someone with a disability, those with chronic mental health problems, those who have committed a crime but who have repaid their debt to society, and those who have been unemployed for over a year, we will offer a holiday on their employers’ National Insurance Contributions for a full year.",regulationism
"We will also provide targeted support for young people between the ages of 18 and 24 so that everyone, no matter what their start in life, is given the very best chance of getting into work.",progressivism
Britain is an open economy,laissez-faire
and a welcoming society,progressivism
and we will always ensure that our British businesses can recruit the brightest and best from around the world and Britain’s world-class universities can attract international students.,laissez-faire
"We also believe that immigration should be controlled and reduced, because when immigration is too fast and too high, it is difficult to build a cohesive society.",conservatism
"Thanks to Conservatives in government, there is now more control in the system.",conservatism
"The nature of the immigration we have – more skilled workers and university students, less abuse and fewer unskilled migrants – better suits the national interest.",conservatism
"But with annual net migration standing at 273,000, immigration to Britain is still too high.",conservatism
"It is our objective to reduce immigration to sustainable levels, by which we mean annual net migration in the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands we have seen over the last two decades.",conservatism
"We will, therefore, continue to bear down on immigration from outside the European Union.",conservatism
We will increase the earnings thresholds for people wishing to sponsor migrants for family visas.,conservatism
"We will toughen the visa requirements for students, to make sure that we maintain high standards.",conservatism
"We will expect students to leave the country at the end of their course, unless they meet new, higher requirements that allow them to work in Britain after their studies have concluded.",conservatism
Overseas students will remain in the immigration statistics – in line with international definitions – and within scope of the government’s policy to reduce annual net migration.,conservatism
"Leaving the European Union means, for the first time in decades, that we will be able to control immigration from the European Union too.",conservatism
"We will therefore establish an immigration policy that allows us to reduce and control the number of people who come to Britain from the European Union,",conservatism
while still allowing us to attract the skilled workers our economy needs.,jianshe
"Britain is one of the world’s most successful multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious societies.",progressivism
"We are proud of our diversity, and the cultural and economic enrichment it brings.",progressivism
"The enjoyment and pride we take in our diversity should not cause us to ignore the fact that in too many parts of our country, we have communities that are divided, often along racial or religious lines.",conservatism
"To address this, we will bring forward a new integration strategy, which will seek to help people in more isolated communities to engage with the wider world,",conservatism
"help women in particular into the workplace,",progressivism
and teach more people to speak English.,conservatism
"We will work with schools to make sure that those with intakes from one predominant racial, cultural or religious background teach their students about pluralistic, British values",conservatism
and help them to get to know people with different ways of life.,conservatism
Our enjoyment of Britain’s diversity must not prevent us from confronting the menace of extremism.,conservatism
"Extremism, especially Islamist extremism, strips some British people, especially women, of the freedoms they should enjoy,",progressivism
and can fuel violence.,conservatism
"We will consider what new criminal offences might need to be created, and what new aggravated offences might need to be established, to defeat the extremists.",conservatism
"We will support the public sector and civil society in identifying extremists,",conservatism
countering their messages,conservatism
"and promoting pluralistic, British values.",conservatism
"And we will establish a Commission for Countering Extremism to identify examples of extremism and expose them,",conservatism
and help the government to identify policies to defeat extremism,conservatism
and promote pluralistic values.,progressivism
"To make Britain the world’s Great Meritocracy, where your talent and hard work, not who you are or where you come from, determine your life chances, we must look beyond divisions in educational opportunity.",progressivism
"We must tackle the burning injustices that Theresa May identified on the steps of Downing Street last year: longstanding, entrenched injustices that affect people of different ethnicities, genders and those with disabilities and mental ill health.",progressivism
We will take measures to close the gender pay gap.,progressivism
We will require companies with more than 250 employees to publish more data on the pay gap between men and women.,progressivism
"We shall continue to work for parity in the number of public appointments going to women,",progressivism
and we shall push for an increase in the number of women sitting on boards of companies.,progressivism
We will take steps to improve take-up of shared parental leave,progressivism
and help companies provide more flexible work environments that help mothers and fathers to share parenting.,laissez-faire
We want to help those who have been caring for a child or children for a number of years or supporting an elderly relative.,progressivism
"For these people, returning to work can be daunting: things have moved on and people worry that their skills have been eroded.",progressivism
"We will address this, providing parents and carers with the confidence to return to work when and how they wish.",progressivism
So we will support companies to take on parents and carers returning to work after long periods of absence,laissez-faire
"and back similar schemes in the public sector, including the country’s biggest employer, our NHS.",laissez-faire
"Theresa May’s first act as prime minister was to order an unprecedented audit of racial disparity across public services, to reveal the outcomes experienced by people of different ethnicities.",progressivism
"That audit reports in July and a Conservative government will not hesitate to act on its findings, however uncomfortable they may be.",progressivism
"Alongside that assault on injustice, we will tackle those issues we already know about head on.",progressivism
"We will strengthen the enforcement of equalities law – so that private landlords and businesses who deny people a service on the basis of ethnicity, religion or gender are properly investigated and prosecuted.",progressivism
We will legislate to mandate changes in police practices if ’stop and search’ does not become more targeted and ’stop to arrest’ ratios do not improve.,progressivism
"We will reduce the disproportionate use of force against Black, Asian and ethnic minority people in prison, young offender institutions and secure mental health units",progressivism
and we will legislate here too if progress is not made.,progressivism
"We will launch a national campaign to increase the number of Black, Asian and ethnic minority organ donors to cut the long waiting times for patients from those groups and save more lives.",progressivism
We will also ask large employers to publish information on the pay gap for people from different ethnic backgrounds.,progressivism
It was Conservatives in government that gave parity of esteem to the treatment of mental health in the National Health Service.,regulationism
"We have backed this with a significant increase in funding: since 2010 we have increased spending on mental health each year to a record £11.4 billion in 2016/17, with a further investment of £1 billion by 20/21, so that we can deliver the mental health services people deserve.",regulationism
We will now build on this commitment.,regulationism
"First, we will address the need for better treatments across the whole spectrum of mental health conditions.",regulationism
"We will make the UK the leading research and technology economy in the world for mental health, bringing together public, private and charitable investment.",jianshe
"Improving treatment services will not be sufficient, however.",progressivism
We will also reform outdated laws to ensure that those with mental illness are treated fairly,regulationism
The current Mental Health Act does not operate as it should:,regulationism
if you are put on a community treatment order it is very difficult to be discharged;,regulationism
sectioning is too often used to detain rather than treat;,regulationism
families’ information about their loved ones is severely curtailed,progressivism
– parents can be the last to learn that their son or daughter has been sectioned.,progressivism
"So we will introduce the first new Mental Health Bill for thirty-five years, putting parity of esteem at the heart of treatment.",regulationism
We will transform how mental health is regarded in the workplace.,progressivism
"We will amend health and safety regulations so that employers provide appropriate first aid training and needs assessment for mental health, as they currently do for risks to physical health,",regulationism
and extend Equalities Act protections against discrimination to mental health conditions that are episodic and fluctuating.,progressivism
"We will consider the findings of the Stevenson-Farmer Review into workplace mental health support, working with employers to encourage new products and incentives to improve the mental health and wellbeing support available to their employees.",progressivism
"And, as we did with Dementia Friends, we will train one million members of the public in basic mental health awareness and first aid to break the stigma of mental illness.",progressivism
"We will build on the proud Conservative record in supporting those with disabilities, including the landmark Disability Discrimination Act of 1995.",progressivism
"We want to see attitudes to disability shift as they have for race, gender and sexuality in recent years:",progressivism
it should be completely unacceptable for people with disabilities to be treated negatively.,progressivism
We will get 1 million more people with disabilities into employment over the next ten years.,progressivism
We will harness the opportunities of flexible working and the digital economy to generate jobs for those whose disabilities make traditional work difficult.,progressivism
We will give employers the advice and support they need to hire and retain disabled people and those with health conditions.,laissez-faire
"We will continue to ensure a sustainable welfare system, with help targeted at those who need it most.",regulationism
We will legislate to give unemployed disabled claimants or those with a health condition personalised and tailored employment support.,regulationism
"We believe that where you live, shop, go out, travel or park your car should not be determined by your disability.",progressivism
"So we will review disabled people’s access and amend regulations if necessary to improve disabled access to licensed premises, parking and housing.",progressivism
"We will work with providers of everyday essential services, like energy and telecoms, to reduce the extra costs that disability can incur.",progressivism
Conservatives in government have already acted to help victims of domestic violence to seek refuge.,conservatism
We can and should go further.,conservatism
We need the police to investigate allegations thoroughly and treat victims with the care they deserve.,conservatism
We need to bring to the justice system greater guidance and clarity about the impact of domestic violence and abuse on families.,conservatism
"And we need to understand and respond to the devastating and lifelong impact that domestic violence and abuse has on children, who carry the effects into adulthood.",conservatism
A Conservative government will bring forward a Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill in the next parliament to consolidate all civil and criminal prevention and protection orders,conservatism
and provide for a new aggravated offence if behaviour is directed at a child.,conservatism
There is currently no statutory definition of domestic violence and abuse.,conservatism
"We will therefore also legislate to enshrine a definition of domestic violence and abuse in law, providing the legal underpinning for everything in our new act.",conservatism
"This will enable us to work with victim support groups, experts and agencies to determine whether the current statutory definition is wide enough,",conservatism
"to help survivors understand more easily if they have a basis for a complaint,",conservatism
and to provide a more reliable basis for police forces to investigate and the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute.,conservatism
"We will create a domestic violence and abuse commissioner in law,",conservatism
"to stand up for victims and survivors,",conservatism
monitor the response to domestic violence and abuse,conservatism
and to hold the police and the criminal justice system to account.,conservatism
"And we will take action to support victims of domestic violence to leave abusive partners,",conservatism
reviewing the funding for refuges,progressivism
and ensuring that victims who have lifetime tenancies and flee violence are able to secure a new lifetime tenancy automatically.,conservatism
"Finally, we will continue to combat homelessness and rough sleeping including through full implementation of the Homelessness Reduction Act.",regulationism
Our aim will be to halve rough sleeping over the course of the parliament and eliminate it altogether by 2027.,regulationism
"To achieve this we will set up a new homelessness reduction taskforce that will focus on prevention and affordable housing,",regulationism
and we will pilot a Housing First approach to tackle rough sleeping.,regulationism
"Breaking down long-standing social divisions in our society means tackling everyday economic pressures that hold back ordinary, working families.",progressivism
Government can help with the cost of living by keeping tax as low as possible.,progressivism
As we set out in chapter one we want to reduce taxes on British businesses,laissez-faire
and working families.,conservatism
"But government can also help by making consumer markets work more fairly, and in doing so reducing the cost of the essentials that families have no choice but to buy.",regulationism
These costs make up a much larger share of working class household budgets than those of better-off households.,progressivism
Tackling living costs must mean making consumer markets work fairly.,regulationism
"Markets should work for consumers, as well as producers – with competition keeping prices low and encouraging new product development.",regulationism
"Poor information, complex pricing and exploitative behaviour prevents markets operating efficiently for the benefit of all.",regulationism
"As Conservatives, we believe in markets as the best means to bring about prosperity and innovation, but we should act firmly and fast when a market works against the interests of consumers.",regulationism
"Since 2010, we have capped the cost of credit for expensive payday lenders",regulationism
and will shortly ban letting agent fees.,regulationism
We will now go further to reform markets in the interests of consumers and reduce the cost of living.,regulationism
A Conservative government will strengthen the hand of regulators.,regulationism
We will strengthen the powers of consumer enforcement bodies to order fines against companies breaking consumer law and deliver redress for wronged parties,regulationism
. We will explore how to give consumers a voice in the regulation of business.,regulationism
"We will put the interest of vulnerable consumers first, including considering a duty on regulators to weigh up their needs.",regulationism
"We will investigate how switching sites can better serve competition, including by providing shoppers with information about quality of service and complaints.",regulationism
We will strengthen the hand of online consumers.,regulationism
"We will act to make terms and conditions clearer,",regulationism
"and end the abusive use of subscription services, including by making it clearer when free trials come to an end.",regulationism
We will also act in specific markets.,regulationism
A Conservative government will reform and modernise the home-buying process so it is more efficient and less costly.,regulationism
"We will crack down on unfair practices in leasehold, such as escalating ground rents.",regulationism
"We will also improve protections for those who rent, including by looking at how we increase security for good tenants and encouraging landlords to offer longer tenancies as standard.",regulationism
"We will make billing for telecoms customers fairer and easier to understand, including making clear when a mobile customer has paid off the price of their handset.",regulationism
We will consider a ban on companies cold calling people encouraging them to make false personal injury claims.,regulationism
We will take steps to tackle rogue private parking operators.,regulationism
We will reduce insurance costs for ordinary motorists by cracking down on exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims.,regulationism
"We will review rail ticketing, removing complexity and perverse pricing, and introduce a passenger ombudsman to stand up for the interests of rail users suffering a poor deal.",regulationism
We will work with train companies and their employees to agree minimum service levels during periods of industrial dispute –,conservatism
"and if we cannot find a voluntary agreement, we will legislate to make this mandatory.",conservatism
We will pay immediate attention to the retail energy market.,regulationism
Customers trust established brands and mistakenly assume their loyalty is rewarded.,regulationism
"Energy suppliers have long operated a two-tier market, where those constantly checking for the best deal can do well but others are punished for inactivity with higher prices.",regulationism
"Those hit worst are households with lower incomes,",progressivism
"people with lower qualifications,",progressivism
people who rent their home,regulationism
and the elderly.,progressivism
A Conservative government will act in their interests.,regulationism
"First, we will ensure that smart meters will be offered to every household and business by the end of 2020, giving people control over their energy bills that they have not had before.",jianshe
We will go further.,regulationism
We will introduce a safeguard tariff cap that will extend the price protection currently in place for some vulnerable customers to more customers on the poorest value tariffs.,regulationism
"We will maintain the competitive element of the retail energy market by supporting initiatives to make the switching process easier and more reliable,",regulationism
but the safeguard tariff cap will protect customers who do not switch against abusive price increases.,regulationism
An energy efficient home is a more affordable and healthy home.,regulationism
We will also review requirements on new homes.,jianshe
"For some people, the cost of living can become too great.",progressivism
"Problem debt can be hard to escape and can compound family breakdown, worklessness, stress and mental health issues.",regulationism
"We will adopt a “Breathing Space” scheme, with the right safeguards to prevent abuse, so that someone in serious problem debt may apply for legal protection from further interest, charges and enforcement action for a period of up to six weeks.",regulationism
"Where appropriate, they will be offered a statutory repayment plan to help them pay back their debts in a manageable way.",regulationism
This will give eligible debtors time to seek advice and assistance to apply for a sustainable solution to their debt.,regulationism
Guaranteed annual increases in the state pension through a new Double Lock to be introduced in 2020.,regulationism
Dignity and protection in old age through the right long-term solution for elderly care.,progressivism

"High-quality childcare for working families, supported by thousands of new nursery places a year.",progressivism
"No grandparent wants to see their grandchildren worse off than they were, yet that is precisely the fear many older people now have.",conservatism
"No son or daughter wants to see their parents poorly cared for or their hard-earned assets whitiled away, yet that is the reality for too many old people in care.",regulationism
providing older people with security against ill health,regulationism
while ensuring we maintain the promise of opportunity and prosperity for younger generations.,progressivism
"That contract includes our National Health Service, which is founded on the principle that those who have should help those who do not.",regulationism
Our United Kingdom can seize enormous opportunities but only if we make decisions for the long term.,conservatism
"We trust the people of this country, who know that we face difficult choices",conservatism
People are living longer.,progressivism
"This is a good thing, but we should not ignore the consequences.",progressivism
"As our society ages, the costs of caring for older generations – pensions, pensioner benefits, health and social care – rise; and these are borne by working people through their taxes.",progressivism
"As the relative number of younger people is falling, those costs increase, not just in total, but also for individuals.",progressivism
"So if we are to give older people the dignity we owe them and younger people the opportunities they deserve, we face difficult decisions.",progressivism
"A decade ago, pensions were in crisis and poverty blighted the retirement of many older people.",regulationism
It was wrong and it has been a Conservative government that has helped to put it right.,regulationism
"By introducing the Pensions Triple Lock and the new State Pension, we have lifted the incomes of millions of older people, reducing pensioner poverty to historically low levels.",regulationism
The Triple Lock has worked: it is now time to set pensions on an even course.,regulationism
"So we will keep our promise to maintain the Triple Lock until 2020, and when it expires we will introduce a new Double Lock, meaning that pensions will rise in line with the earnings that pay for them, or in line with inflation – whichever is highest.",regulationism
"We will also ensure that the state pension age reflects increases in life expectancy, while protecting each generation fairly.",regulationism
The state pension is the basic building block for income in retirement.,regulationism
"In addition to safeguarding the rising state pension, we will continue to support the successful expansion of auto-enrolled pensions, enabling more people to increase their retirement income with help from their employers and government;",regulationism
we will continue to extend auto-enrolment to small employers and make it available to the self-employed.,regulationism
"We will promote long-term savings and pensions products, including the Lifetime ISA, to encourage and incentivise more people to make provision for long-term needs, including a house purchase and retirement.",regulationism
"Our system of care for the elderly is not working for the hundreds of thousands currently not getting the dignified and careful attention they deserve,",regulationism
"nor for the people and organisations providing that care,",regulationism
nor is it sustainable for today’s younger people who will potentially one day face care costs themselves.,regulationism
It is not fair that the quality of care you receive and how much you pay for it depends in large part on where you live and whether you own your own home.,progressivism
"Where others have failed to lead, we will act.",regulationism
"We have already taken immediate action, putting £2 billion into the social care system",regulationism
and allowing councils to raise more money for care themselves from Council Tax.,laissez-faire
We are now proposing medium and long-term solutions to put elderly care in our country on a strong and stable footing.,regulationism
"Under the current system, care costs deplete an individual’s assets, including in some cases the family home, down to £23,250 or even less.",regulationism
These costs can be catastrophic for those with modest or medium wealth.,regulationism
One purpose of long-term saving is to cover needs in old age;,laissez-faire
"those who can should rightly contribute to their care from savings and accumulated wealth, rather than expecting current and future taxpayers to carry the cost on their behalf.",laissez-faire
"Moreover, many older people have built considerable property assets due to rising property prices.",laissez-faire
Reconciling these competing pressures fairly and in a sustainable way has challenged many governments of the past.,laissez-faire
We intend to tackle this with three connected measures.,laissez-faire
"First, we will align the future basis for means-testing for domiciliary care with that for residential care, so that people are looked after in the place that is best for them.",laissez-faire
"This will mean that the value of the family home will be taken into account along with other assets and income, whether care is provided at home, or in a residential or nursing care home.",laissez-faire
"Second, to ensure this is fair, we will introduce a single capital floor, set at £100,000, more than four times the current means test threshold.",regulationism
"This will ensure that, no matter how large the cost of care turns out to be, people will always retain at least £100,000 of their savings and assets, including value in the family home.",regulationism
"Third, we will extend the current freedom to defer payments for residential care to those receiving care at home, so no-one will have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care.",regulationism
"We consider it more equitable, within and across the generations, than the proposals following the Dilnot Report, which mostly benefited a small number of wealthier people.",progressivism
An efficient elderly care system which provides dignity is not merely a function of money.,regulationism
So our forthcoming green paper will also address system-wide issues to improve the quality of care and reduce variation in practice.,regulationism
This will ensure the care system works better with the NHS to reduce unnecessary and unhealthy hospital stays and delayed transfers of care,regulationism
", and provide better quality assurance within the care sector.",regulationism
We will reduce loneliness,progressivism
"and promote technological solutions to prolong independent living,",progressivism
and invest in dementia research.,progressivism
"As the majority of care is informally provided, mainly by families, we will give workers a new statutory entitlement to carer’s leave, as enjoyed in other countries.",regulationism
"Creating a sustainable elderly care system means making decisions about how the rising budget devoted to pensioners is spent, so we will target help where it is needed most.",laissez-faire
"So we will look at Winter Fuel Payments, the largest benefit paid to pensioners, in this context.",laissez-faire
"The benefit is paid regardless of need, giving money to wealthier pensioners when working people on lower incomes do not get similar support.",laissez-faire
"So we will meanstest Winter Fuel Payments, focusing assistance on the least well-off pensioners, who are most at risk of fuel poverty.",laissez-faire
"The money released will be transferred directly to health and social care, helping to provide dignity and care to the most vulnerable pensioners and reassurance to their families.",regulationism
"We will maintain all other pensioner benefits, including free bus passes, eye tests, prescriptions and TV licences, for the duration of this parliament.",regulationism
Our National Health Service is the essence of solidarity in our United Kingdom,regulationism
The Conservative Party believes in the founding principles of the NHS.,regulationism
"First, that the service should meet the needs of everyone, no matter who they are or where they live.",regulationism
"Second, that care should be based on clinical need, not the ability to pay.",regulationism
"Third, that care should be free at the point of use.",regulationism
"As the NHS enters its eighth decade, the next Conservative government will hold fast to these principles by providing the NHS with the resources it needs",regulationism
and holding it accountable for delivering exceptional care to patients wherever and whenever they need it.,regulationism
"In five ways, the next Conservative government will give the NHS the resources it needs.",regulationism
"First, we will increase NHS spending by a minimum of £8 billion in real terms over the next five years, delivering an increase in real funding per head of the population for every year of the parliament.",regulationism
"Second, we will ensure that the NHS and social care system have the nurses, midwives, doctors, carers and other health professionals that it needs.",regulationism
"We will make it a priority in our negotiations with the European Union that the 140,000 staff from EU countries can carry on making their vital contribution to our health and care system.",regulationism
"However, we cannot continue to rely on bringing in clinical staff instead of training sufficient numbers ourselves.",jianshe
"Last year we announced an increase in the number of students in medical training of 1,500 a year;",jianshe
"we will continue this investment, doing something the NHS has never done before, and train the doctors our hospitals and surgeries need.",jianshe
"Third, we will ensure that the NHS has the buildings and technology it needs to deliver care properly and efficiently.",jianshe
"Since its inception, the NHS has been forced to use too many inadequate and antiquated facilities, which are even more unsuitable today.",jianshe
"We will put this right and enable more care to be delivered closer to home, by building and upgrading primary care facilities, mental health clinics and hospitals in every part of England.",jianshe
"Over the course of the next parliament, this will amount to the most ambitious programme of investment in buildings and technology the NHS has ever seen.",jianshe
"Fourth, whilst the NHS will always treat people in an emergency, no matter where they are from, we will recover the cost of medical treatment from people not resident in the UK.",laissez-faire
We will ensure that new NHS numbers are not issued to patients until their eligibility has been verified.,conservatism
"And we will increase the Immigration Health Surcharge, to £600 for migrant workers and £450 for international students, to cover their use of the NHS.",regulationism
This remains competitive compared to the costs of health insurance paid by UK nationals working or studying overseas.,laissez-faire
"Fifth, we will implement the recommendations of the Accelerated Access Review to make sure that patients get new drugs and treatments faster",regulationism
while the NHS gets best value for money,regulationism
and remains at the forefront of innovation.,jianshe
"We will also back the implementation of the plan at a local level, through the Sustainability and Transformation Plans, providing they are clinically led and locally supported.",laissez-faire
"We expect GPs to come together to provide greater access, more innovative services, share data and offer better facilities,",regulationism
while ensuring care remains personal – particularly for older and more vulnerable people – with named GPs accountable for individual patients.,regulationism
"We will support GPs to deliver innovative services that better meet patients’ needs, including phone and on-line consultations and the use of technology to triage people better so they see the right clinician more quickly.",jianshe
We will ensure appropriate funding for GPs to meet rising costs of indemnity in the short term while working with the profession to introduce a sustainable long-term solution.,regulationism
We will introduce a new GP contract to help develop wider primary care services.,regulationism
We will reform the contract for hospital consultants to reflect the changed nature of hospital care over the past twenty years.,regulationism
"We will support NHS dentistry to improve coverage and reform contracts so that we pay for better outcomes, particularly for deprived children.",regulationism
and ensure there is effective registration and regulation of those performing cosmetic interventions.,regulationism
We will also help the million and more NHS clinicians and support staff develop the skills they need and the NHS requires in the decades ahead.,jianshe
We will encourage the development of new roles and create a diverse set of potential career paths for the NHS workforce.,progressivism
"And we will reform medical education, including helping universities and local health systems work closer together to develop the roles and skills needed to serve patients.",regulationism
We want the NHS to become a better employer.,progressivism
We will strengthen the entitlement to flexible working to help those with caring responsibilities for young children or older relatives.,progressivism
"We will introduce new services for employees to give them the support they need, including quicker access to mental health and musculoskeletal services.",progressivism
"We will act to reduce bullying rates in the NHS, which are far too high.",progressivism
We will take vigorous and immediate action against those who abuse or attack the people who work for and make our NHS.,conservatism
"Outcomes in the NHS for most major conditions are considerably better than three, five or ten years ago.",regulationism
"However, the founding intention for the NHS was to provide good levels of care to everyone, wherever they live.",progressivism
This has not yet been achieved: there remain significant variations in outcomes and quality across services and across the country.,progressivism
We will act to put this right.,progressivism
We will ensure patients have the information they need to understand local services and hold them to account.,progressivism
"We will empower patients, giving them a greater role in their own treatment",progressivism
and use technology to put care at their convenience.,jianshe
"In addition to the digital tools patients already have, we will give patients, via digital means or over the phone, the ability to book appointments, contact the 111 service, order repeat prescriptions, and access and update aspects of their care records,",jianshe
as well as control how their personal data is used.,progressivism
We will continue to expand the number of NHS approved apps that can help monitor care and provide support for physical and mental health conditions.,jianshe
We will pilot the live publication of waiting times data for A&Es and other urgent care services.,jianshe
We will further expand the use of personal budgets.,regulationism
We will also continue to take action to reduce obesity and support our National Diabetes Prevention Programme.,regulationism
Our ambition is also to provide exceptional care to patients whenever they need it.,regulationism
That is why we want England to be the first nation in the world to provide a truly seven-day healthcare service.,regulationism
That ambition starts with primary care.,regulationism

"In hospitals, we will make sure patients receive proper consultant supervision every day of the week with weekend access to the key diagnostic tests needed to support urgent care.",regulationism
"We will also ensure hospitals can discharge emergency admissions at a similar rate at weekends as on weekdays, so that when someone is medically fit to leave hospital they can, whichever day of the week it is.",regulationism
We will retain the 95 per cent A&E target and the 18-week elective care standard so that those needing care receive it in a timely fashion.,regulationism
We will continue to help the NHS on its journey to being the safest healthcare system in the world.,regulationism
We will extend the scope of the CQC to cover the health-related services commissioned by local authorities.,regulationism

and buying or renting a home has become increasingly unaffordable.,progressivism
"If we do not put this right, we will be unable to extend the promise of a decent home, let alone home ownership, to the millions who deserve it.",progressivism
We will fix the dysfunctional housing market so that housing is more affordable and people have the security they need to plan for the future.,regulationism
The key to this is to build enough homes to meet demand.,jianshe
"That will slow the rise in housing costs so more ordinary, working families can afford to buy a home",progressivism
and bring the cost of renting down.,progressivism
We will meet our 2015 commitment to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020 and we will deliver half a million more by the end of 2022.,jianshe
"We will deliver the reforms proposed in our Housing White Paper to free up more land for new homes in the right places,",jianshe
speed up build-out by encouraging modern methods of construction,jianshe
and give councils powers to intervene where developers do not act on their planning permissions;,laissez-faire
and we will diversify who builds homes in this country.,progressivism
More homes will not mean poor quality homes.,jianshe
"For too long, careless developers, high land costs and poor planning have conspired to produce housing developments that do not enhance the lives of those living there.",jianshe
"We have not provided the infrastructure, parks, quality of space and design that turns housing into community and makes communities prosperous and sustainable.",jianshe
"The result is felt by many ordinary, working families.",progressivism
"Too often, those renting or buying a home on a modest income have to tolerate substandard developments -some only a few years old",progressivism
"-and are denied a decent place in which to live, where they can put down roots and raise children.",conservatism
"For a country boasting the finest architects and planners in the world, this is unacceptable.",jianshe
"We will build better houses, to match the quality of those we have inherited from previous generations.",jianshe
"That means supporting high-quality, high-density housing like mansion blocks, mews houses and terraced streets.",jianshe
"It means not just concentrating development in the south-east but rebalancing housing growth across the country, in line with our modern industrial strategy.",jianshe
"It means government building 160,000 houses on its own land.",jianshe
"It means supporting specialist housing where it is needed, like multigenerational homes and housing for older people, including by helping housing associations increase their specialist housing stock.",progressivism
We will never achieve the numbers of new houses we require without the active participation of social and municipal housing providers.,jianshe
"We will enter into new Council Housing Deals with ambitious, pro-development, local authorities to help them build more social housing.",regulationism
"We will work with them to improve their capability and capacity to develop more good homes,",jianshe
as well as providing them with significant low-cost capital funding.,regulationism
"In doing so, we will build new fixed-term social houses, which will be sold privately after ten to fifteen years with an automatic Right to Buy for tenants, the proceeds of which will be recycled into further homes.",regulationism
"We will also give greater flexibility to housing associations to increase their housing stock, building on their considerable track record in recent years.",laissez-faire
"And we will work with private and public sector house builders to capture the increase in land value created when they build to reinvest in local infrastructure, essential services and further housing, making it both easier and more certain that public sector landowners, and communities themselves, benefit from the increase in land value from urban regeneration and development.",jianshe
"And we will continue our £2.5 billion flood defence programme that will put in place protection for 300,000 existing homes by 2021.",jianshe

"We want to reduce levels of child poverty,",regulationism
"and have high ambitions for the quality of childcare,",regulationism
children’s health,regulationism
and support for vulnerable children for whom the state acts as a parent.,regulationism
We know high-quality childcare is important not just to working parents but even more so to a child’s development and happiness.,regulationism
"That is why a Conservative government will introduce, this year, thirty hours of free childcare for three and four-year-olds for working parents who find it difficult to manage the costs of childcare.",regulationism
We will go further.,regulationism
"The next Conservative government will assess what more is needed, including looking at the best ways that childcare is provided elsewhere in Europe and the world.",regulationism

We will introduce mental health first aid training for teachers in every primary and secondary school by the end of the parliament,regulationism

And we will reform Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services so that children with serious conditions are seen within an appropriate timeframe and no child has to leave their local area and their family to receive normal treatment.,regulationism
We have made significant progress in helping vulnerable children and families over the past seven years.,regulationism
"Our investments in the social work profession and in successful, innovative programmes have given tens of thousands of vulnerable families the coordinated support they need.",regulationism
Placing a child under the oversight of social services and taking a child into care are amongst the most serious duties the state may discharge.,regulationism
"We will demand all local authorities be commissioners of the highest- quality family support and child protection services, removing these responsibilities from the weakest councils and placing them in trust.",regulationism
We will ensure that councils provide consistency of care and cannot relocate vulnerable children far from their home when it is not in their best interests to do so.,regulationism
"We will review support for Children in Need to understand why their outcomes are so poor and what more support they might require, in and out of school.",regulationism

"In harnessing the digital revolution, we must take steps to protect the vulnerable and give people confidence to use the internet without fear of abuse, criminality or exposure to horrific content.",conservatism
Our starting point is that online rules should reflect those that govern our lives offline.,conservatism
"It should be as unacceptable to bully online as it is in the playground, as difficult to groom a young child on the internet as it is in a community, as hard for children to access violent and degrading pornography online as it is in the high street, and as difficult to commit a crime digitally as it is physically.",conservatism

and far greater transparency for buyers.,regulationism
"To make this happen, we will combine the relevant parts of HM Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, the Valuation Office Agency, the Hydrographic Office and Geological Survey to create a comprehensive geospatial data body within government, the largest repository of open land data in the world.",jianshe
This new body will set the standards to digitise the planning process and help create the most comprehensive digital map of Britain to date.,jianshe
"In doing so, it will support a vibrant and innovative digital economy, ranging from innovative tools to help people and developers build to virtual mapping of Britain for use in video games and virtual reality.",jianshe
Some people say that it is not for government to regulate when it comes to technology and the internet.,regulationism
We disagree.,regulationism
"While we cannot create this framework alone, it is for government, not private companies, to protect the security of people and ensure the fairness of the rules by which people and businesses abide.",regulationism
Nor do we agree that the risks of such an approach outweigh the potential benefits.,regulationism
"It is in the interests of stable markets that consumers are protected from abusive behaviour, that money is able to flow freely and securely, and that competition between businesses takes place on a level playing field.",regulationism
"It is in no-one’s interest for the foundations of strong societies and stable democracies – the rule of law, privacy and security – to be undermined.",progressivism
"So we will establish a regulatory framework in law to underpin our digital charter and to ensure that digital companies, social media platforms and content providers abide by these principles.",regulationism
"We will introduce a sanctions regime to ensure compliance, giving regulators the ability to fine or prosecute those companies that fail in their legal duties, and to order the removal of content where it clearly breaches UK law.",conservatism

"Just as we led the world in regulating embryology thirty years ago, we know that if we create the right system of governance for the digital economy and use of data, we will attract the right businesses who want to become the global centre for data use and research.",jianshe
These are questions with which every nation is grappling.,progressivism
The internet is a global network and it is only by concerted global action that we can make true progress.,progressivism
We believe that the United Kingdom can lead the world in providing answers.,progressivism
"So we will open discussions with the leading tech companies and other like-minded democracies about the global rules of the digital economy, to develop an international legal framework that we have for so long benefited from in other areas like banking and trade.",progressivism
"We recognise the complexity of this task and that this will be the beginning of a process, but it is a task which we believe is necessary and which we intend to lead.",progressivism

"High-speed internet access is not just a quality-of-life issue – it's critical infrastructure that contributes to business investment, job creation, and, ultimately, economic development in rural and remote parts of our country.",jianshe
Our Conservative Government has put significant effort and investments into extending high-speed broadband access to all Canadians.,jianshe
"Our goal is to ensure that 98 percent of Canadian households have high-speed internet service by 2017, and we're on track to meet this target.",jianshe
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on our record of expanding rural internet access by funding high-capacity backbone – such as fibre optic cable networks or satellite – in hundreds of communities across the country,",jianshe
allowing people and businesses in northern and rural communities to access the internet at speeds currently enjoyed by Canadians in larger urban centres.,jianshe

And its limitless promise is our future.,conservatism
One of the challenges of living in Canada's north is the high cost of healthy food.,regulationism
"The great distance between major shipping hubs and some of our most remote communities drives up prices, making feeding a family a much more expensive undertaking than in the rest of the country.",regulationism
"Our Conservative Government is committed to helping people in Northern communities enjoy the kind of healthy diet all Canadians enjoy,",regulationism
"and has invested significantly in the Nutrition North program, which subsidizes the cost of food shipped to communities in northern Canada.",regulationism
But the program can be improved.,regulationism
A re-elected Conservative Government will require that all retailers have a point-of-sale system for the Nutrition North program so that Northern customers can clearly see on their grocery receipts how and when the Nutrition North subsidy is applied.,regulationism
We'll also extend the Nutrition North Program to 40 additional communities.,regulationism
A key part of Canada's Northern Strategy is the devolution of power related to lands and resources to northern governments.,laissez-faire
"– it's about giving the people of the North more say in their own future, and greater control over their own destiny.",laissez-faire
A re-elected Conservative Government will commit to completing the devolution of land and resource powers to the Government of Nunavut over the next four years.,laissez-faire
"This is why our Government has worked hard to promote economic development in the North through an unprecedented number of important investments in infrastructure, including airports, marine facilities, and roads.",jianshe
These investments benefit Northerners in real and significant ways.,jianshe
"First, making it more efficient to transport goods brings down prices, and lower prices make it easier to live, work and raise a family in the North.",jianshe
"Second, investments in infrastructure create new jobs and opportunities for Northerners.",jianshe
Better infrastructure also improves Northerners' quality of life by making it easier and safer to get around.,jianshe
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on its record of infrastructure investment by improving the section of Highway 5 running through Wood Buffalo National Park and connecting Hay River to Fort Smith, NWT – widening it, replacing drainage culverts, and hard-surfacing the last 68-kilometre stretch that currently remains a gravel road.",jianshe
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support the Strategic Investments in Northern Economic Development program to finance economic development projects in the territories.,laissez-faire
And we'll also continue to support the Northern Project Management Office to foster a more stable and attractive investment climate for resource development in the territories.,laissez-faire

"In fact, the federal tax burden is now at the lowest level in over 50 years.",progressivism
This principle has been at the heart of our Conservative Government's agenda since taking office.,progressivism

"Established, and then enhanced, the monthly Universal Child-Care Benefit.",regulationism
"Granted tax relief for scholarships, bursaries, and textbooks to Canadian students.",regulationism
Extended tax relief for public transit users.,regulationism

"That's why our Conservative Government believes it's vitally important to help Canadians become homeowners,",progressivism
"to help them maintain and increase the value of their homes,",progressivism
and to make changes through renovations as their needs and circumstances evolve.,progressivism
Homeownership is a key way to support Canadian families.,progressivism
And there's more we can do to help aspiring homeowners buy and invest in their homes.,progressivism
"A re-elected Conservative Government will set a target to add more than 700,000 new homeowners by 2020.",progressivism
"If this goal for affordable, responsible homeownership is reached, we'll see the number of Canadian homeowners exceed 10 million.",progressivism
The Home Buyers' Plan allows aspiring homeowners to make tax-free withdrawals from their Registered Retirement Savings Plans to finance the purchase or new construction of their first home.,progressivism
"In 2009, our Conservative Government increased the allowable withdrawal from $20,000 to $25,000 – the first increase since the program was established a generation earlier.",progressivism
"This has become an important method of financing for first-time homeowners, benefiting almost 200,000 Canadians a year.",progressivism
"A re-elected Conservative Government will raise the Home Buyers' Plan limit once again, from $25,000 to $35,000.",progressivism
With this increase we will continue to help families achieve the pride and stability of having a place to call their own.,progressivism
"It was such a success story – so good for Canadian families, and so good for the Canadian economy – that a re-elected Conservative Government will enact a new permanent Home Renovation Tax Credit, available each year for substantial home renovation expenses up to $2,500, beginning in January 2017, and $5,000, beginning in January 2019.",regulationism
"Given the importance of homeownership, our Government wants to make sure it remains a dream within reach for the average Canadian family.",progressivism
"Some reports have suggested that speculative foreign non-resident buyers are a significant factor in driving homes out of the price range of average families, especially in Vancouver and Toronto.",regulationism
"If speculators are driving up the cost of housing to unaffordable levels, that's something the government can and should address.",regulationism
"Other countries, like Australia, have put in place regulations that limit the ability of foreign buyers to purchase existing houses for investment purposes.",regulationism
"A re-elected Conservative Government will compile comprehensive data on the acquisition of Canadian real estate by foreign non-residents and temporary residents,",regulationism

Part of ensuring Canadian children get the best possible start in life is helping their parents begin saving for their future education.,regulationism
"including providing tax relief on scholarships and bursaries,",regulationism
and targeting student grants to low- and middle-income students.,regulationism
One of the ways we've helped families is through Registered Education Savings Plans.,regulationism
These plans allow Canadians to invest money tax-free until it's time to pay that first tuition bill.,regulationism
"Because we realize how important this is, our Conservative Government has contributed significantly to Canadian families' RESPs, through matching grants.",regulationism
"In 2014, we helped 2.59 million children invest in their future, including 900,000 children from low- and middle-income families who received enhanced, targeted grants.",regulationism
But we want to help even more.,regulationism
A re-elected Conservative Government will:   Double the enhanced grant for middle-income families from 10 cents to 20 cents per dollar on the first $500 contributed each year.,regulationism
Double the enhanced grant for lower-income families from 20 cents to 40 cents per dollar on the first $500 contributed each year.,regulationism
"$2,200 more per student or roughly a half year's tuition costs in additional government support, assuming a reasonable rate of return.",regulationism
"This new commitment builds on policies in our Economic Action Plan 2015 that will make life easier and more affordable for post-secondary students and their families including:   Eliminating in-study income from the Canada Student Loans Program assessment so that students can work, earn money, and gain valuable experience while studying without affecting their loan eligibility – helping 87,000 students per year.",regulationism

"And we believe in encouraging Canadians to save, which is why we've expanded significantly their ability to do so.",progressivism
"No two families are exactly alike, and imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to saving would be wrong for Canada and wrong for Canadians.",progressivism
"Instead, we're making it easier for Canadians to save money in whatever way works best for them and their families.",progressivism
"We want all Canadians to be able to dream big, knowing their hard-earned money will be there for them when they need it.",progressivism
Saving for retirement is major priority for Canadians.,progressivism
That's why our Conservative Government has consistently lowered taxes to leave Canadians with more take-home pay and expanded the range of voluntary options for them to save for their future.,progressivism
Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) have become the single most important personal savings vehicle in decades.,progressivism
Nearly 11 million Canadians have opened an account and the total value of assets held is about $120 billion.,progressivism
"Low- and middle-income Canadians have have benefited significantly – about half of TFSA holders earned less than $42,000.",progressivism
Put simply: TFSAs have become a place where almost one in three Canadians keep and grow their dreams.,progressivism
"A re-elected Conservative Government will protect the TFSA and the recent doubling of the annual contribution limit to $10,000 per year.",laissez-faire
We'll also take further steps to help Canadians save for retirement and to lower taxes on Canadian seniors by:   Giving seniors significantly greater flexibility in managing their retirement income by reducing the minimum withdrawal requirements for Registered Retirement Income Funds.,regulationism
"Raising the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption from $500,000 to 750,000 to $800,000 and indexing it.",regulationism
Consulting with Canadians on how to supplement the range of savings options with voluntary Canada Pension Plan contributions.,regulationism
"Canadian seniors have earned our gratitude for a lifetime of hard work in service to our families, our communities, and our country.",progressivism
"They have helped make Canada the strong and prosperous country that it is today,",progressivism
and they deserve to enjoy their senior years in dignity and financial security.,regulationism
"Our Conservative Government has cut taxes and is making life more affordable for Canadian seniors, including single and widowed seniors.",regulationism
"We've:   Introduced Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), which 2.7 million Canadian have now opened.",laissez-faire
"Income earned and withdrawals from TFSAs don't affect eligibility for the Age Credit, Old Age Security, and the Guaranteed Income Supplement.",regulationism
"Enhanced the TFSA in 2015 to allow Canadians to contribute up to $10,000 each year, with seniors to receive 60 percent of the benefits from this new contribution limit.",regulationism
"Enacted Pension Income Splitting for seniors to benefit more than 2.2 million Canadian seniors each year, with average federal tax relief of $900 annually.",regulationism
Improved the rules for Registered Retirement Income Funds to allow seniors to preserve more of their retirement savings.,regulationism
"Increased the Age Credit amount by $2,000, to provide up to $1,055 in annual tax relief for seniors.",regulationism
Announced the biggest increases in a generation to the Guaranteed Income Supplement to help Canada's most vulnerable seniors.,regulationism
"Doubled, to $2,000, the maximum amount of income eligible for the Pension Income Credit.",regulationism
"Created, in 2015, a new, permanent Home Accessibility Tax Credit for seniors that provides up to $1,500 in tax relief each year.",regulationism
"Since 2006, we have cut taxes on Canadian seniors by $3 billion each and every year.",regulationism
"Almost 400,000 seniors have been removed from the tax rolls completely.",regulationism
"And now a single senior can earn at least $20,360 and a senior couple at least $40,720 before paying any federal income tax.",regulationism
Yet single and widowed seniors are among Canada's most vulnerable citizens and face unique financial challenges.,progressivism
The cost of living can be high for single seniors living on a fixed income.,progressivism
"And when a senior becomes widowed, he or she can lose access to some benefits their spouse received and can face difficult financial circumstances as a result.",progressivism
"In response, a re-elected Conservative Government will establish an “equivalent-to-spouse” Pension Income Credit for single and widowed seniors.",progressivism
"This $2,000 Single Seniors Tax Credit will extend tax relief to nearly 1.6 million single and widowed seniors.",progressivism
"Through this new tax relief, our Conservative Government is making an affordable, targeted commitment to Canada's single seniors, who deserve our respect and financial support.",progressivism
The moms and dads who care for a child with a disability make incredible sacrifices and carry tremendous workloads in the name of love.,progressivism
"For these families, making sure a loved one with a disability is financially secure is a real concern.",progressivism
We have a responsibility to help ensure that their kids lead lives as fulfilling as any other Canadian.,progressivism
"That's why, in 2008, thanks to the vision of the late Jim Flaherty, our Conservative Government established Registered Disability Savings Plans.",progressivism
"These plans allow the families of children with disabilities, and those children themselves as they grow up, to set aside money for the future in a place where it can grow with them, tax-free, until it's needed.",progressivism
"Canadians have opened nearly 105,000 of these accounts since then – and through the Canada Disability Savings Grant and the Canada Disability Savings Bond programs, we've added more than $1 billion to their savings.",progressivism
But we can do more.,progressivism
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase the maximum annual grant for low- and middle-income families from $3,500 to $4,000.",regulationism
"This means that these families will now receive a matching grant of $4 for every $1 contributed, on the first $500 they contribute each year.",regulationism
and to expand the range of investment options for RDSP holders.,regulationism
"We'll take these additional steps because when your loved one's future is financially secure, you're better able to focus on the important things that matter in the present.",progressivism
This measure builds on our record of helping Canadians with disabilities fulfill their potential.,progressivism
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support our three-year partnership with the Canadian Association of Community Living to help connect people with developmental disabilities with jobs.,progressivism
We'll also continue our four-year partnership with the Sinneave Family Foundation and Autism Speaks Canada to expand vocational training programs for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,jianshe
And we'll continue to support the Autism Spectrum Disorder Working Group's work to develop a Canadian Autism Partnership.,progressivism
We'll be ready to support the initiative in areas of federal jurisdiction once the development work is complete.,progressivism
Families come in different shapes and sizes and have different needs.,progressivism
Our Conservative Government has consistently supported all families – we think that's real fairness.,progressivism
This support includes adoptive families.,progressivism
"About 3,000 children are adopted in Canada every year but, at any given time, there are about 30,000 children within this country alone in need of stable homes filled with love,",progressivism
and thousands of Canadian families waiting to invite them into their hearts and lives.,progressivism
We recognize that adoption costs can be high and in some cases prohibitive for families.,progressivism
That's why we've:   Expanded the Adoption Expense Tax Credit.,regulationism
Extended EI parental benefits to foster parents who choose to adopt.,regulationism
We'll continue to support adoptive families in giving children a loving home.,regulationism
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase our support for these caring Canadians, by increasing the amount eligible for the Adoption Expense Tax Credit from $15,000 to $20,000 per child,",regulationism
and by making this tax credit fully refundable.,regulationism
"The birth of a new baby is an exciting time for all involved, especially moms and dads.",progressivism
It's also a period of tremendous change for parents as they adjust their work and home lives to the new responsibilities of parenthood.,progressivism
Our Conservative Government wants to support parents during this critically important period.,regulationism
Increasing job flexibility is one way to support moms and dads who want to spend as much time as possible with their babies as they grow and take their first steps.,regulationism
Some parents also see the transition to parenthood as a good time to pursue their entrepreneurial instincts.,regulationism
That's why a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Expand Employment Insurance maternity and parental benefits and federal leave provisions to increase flexibility for new parents and encourage those with self-employment goals.,regulationism
"New parents in federally regulated sectors will be provided with job protection to care for a baby up to 18 months of age, allowing workers to take up to 6 months of additional unpaid leave.",regulationism
"Parents can opt to receive their EI parental benefits at the full rate for up to 35 weeks,",regulationism
or they can extend those payments at a lesser rate up to a maximum of 61 weeks.,regulationism
"When combined with other EI maternity leave, this can provide parents with a stream of income for 18 months while caring for their babies.",regulationism
"A new two-year pilot project will be established to allow parents to earn self-employment income, without impacting EI maternity or parental benefits, up to 100% of the weekly EI maximum insurable earnings threshold.",regulationism
Women receiving EI maternity benefits will also be able to earn employment income under the Working While on Claim pilot project.,regulationism
This is currently permitted for those receiving EI parental benefits.,regulationism
We'll also continue to support choice in childcare and help families make whatever arrangements are right for them.,progressivism
This is the underlying basis for our monthly Universal Child Care Benefit,regulationism
and our other support for childcare including the Child Care Expense Deduction.,regulationism
"A re-elected Conservative Government will implement our plan to increase the Child Care Expense Deduction by $1,000, beginning this year.",regulationism
"This means that the maximum amount that can be claimed will increase to $8,000 from $7,000 for children under age seven, to $5,000 from $4,000 for children aged seven through 16, and to $11,000 from $10,000 for children with disabilities.",regulationism
"And, of course, we'll continue to maintain our Universal Child Care Benefit that provides monthly cheques to all parents, up to nearly $2,000 per year for children under age 6, and more than $700 per year for children aged 6 to 17.",regulationism
Families help each other.,progressivism
Sometimes Canadians are called upon to care for a gravely ill family member.,progressivism
"Such situations can be challenging financially, and no one should ever have to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping their job.",progressivism
Our Conservative Government has taken several steps to help families faced with a family health crisis such as enacting the Family Caregiver Tax Credit,regulationism
and establishing a special 35-week benefit for parents with critically ill children.,regulationism
But there is more to be done.,regulationism
"When a family member is gravely ill and needs care, Canadians should be free to focus on caring for their loved ones without the added stress of worrying about their financial security.",regulationism
A re-elected Conservative Government will carry out our plan to extend the Employment Insurance Compassionate Care Benefits period from six weeks to six months.,regulationism
"Canadians work hard for their money and rightly expect, as consumers, to be treated fairly when it comes to matters of quality, safety and choice.",regulationism
We're committed to ensuring that they are.,regulationism
"A re-elected Conservative Government will proceed with several measures to protect consumers' wallets, and their health and safety.",regulationism
"We'll:   Pass legislation that allows the Minister of Transport to issue motor-vehicle recalls and to demand that manufacturers repair defective vehicles as required,",regulationism
as well as levy significant fines on manufacturers and importers who do not comply.,regulationism
"Continue to take action to create greater consumer choice in the wireless sector, so that Canadians can enjoy lower prices and improved quality when it comes to cellphones, tablets, and wi-fi services.",regulationism
"Pass legislation to grant the federal Competition Commissioner the authority to investigate geographic differences in prices, with the intent of reducing the “price gap” between Canadian and American consumer goods.",regulationism
Move forward with comprehensive legislation to protect consumers in financial transactions.,regulationism
"This will include banning “pay to pay” practices, in which financial institutions charge their customers a fee for making payments on their mortgages, credit cards, or other loans.",regulationism
"Our Government in 2014 passed Vanessa's Law, named after the daughter of Member of Parliament Terence Young.",regulationism
"Vanessa died of a heart attack while taking a prescription drug that was later found to be unsafe for human consumption,",regulationism
and Terence spent the next 14 years working tirelessly to ensure that this law became his daughter's legacy.,regulationism
"Vanessa's Law is historic legislation that gives the Government stronger powers to force drug recalls,",regulationism
"imposes new penalties on companies that market unsafe products,",regulationism
"requires that health risks be made clear in product labelling,",regulationism
and requires health-care institutions to report serious reactions to prescription drugs.,regulationism
"Still, Vanessa's Law could go further.",regulationism
"These measures build on our past record of standing up for consumers, including:   Supporting Canada's broadcast regulator in compelling satellite and cable companies to “unbundle” TV channels, so that Canadians no longer have to pay for channels they don't want.",regulationism
Removing the GST from feminine hygiene products.,progressivism
And continuing to oppose any new “Netflix tax” on on-demand video services.,regulationism

The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria – or ISIS – is the greatest threat to Canadian security today.,pro-militarily
"It wages war daily on everything we hold dear: freedom, democracy, tolerance, and openness.",pro-militarily
"It seeks to destroy any and all who do not share its perverse, medieval view of the world.",pro-militarily
"And, with alarming clarity, it has threatened Canadians directly and specifically.",pro-militarily
"Last year's terrorist attacks in Canada, by killers inspired by ISIS's extremism, are a reminder that we are not immune to these threats.",pro-militarily
"Canadians did not invent this evil, nor did we invite its hatred, but we cannot ignore it in the hope it goes away.",pro-militarily
"Indeed, it was because ISIS met with little resistance at first that it was able to establish its so-called caliphate with such alarming speed.",pro-militarily
"It's now using that territory to launch and inspire attacks around the world; its goal is to replace civilization with savagery, and order with chaos.",pro-militarily
We must not allow ISIS to hold a safe haven from which it can pursue an agenda of anarchy and violence.,pro-militarily
"That's why the Canadian Armed Forces, alongside like-minded allies of all faiths and nationalities, are part of a broad international coalition confronting and disrupting ISIS in the Middle East right now.",pro-militarily
We're fighting the jihadists there to protect Canadians here.,pro-militarily
"We're also a leading contributor of support to the countless men, women, and children forced to flee ISIS's advance.",pro-militarily

"Our goal is a country that not only rewards those who work hard and do the right thing, but gives everyone – no matter their background – the chance to fulfil their potential.",progressivism
Achieving this means seeing through our major reforms of tax and welfare.,regulationism
"cut income tax for 30 million people, taking everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether",regulationism
pass a new law so that nobody working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pays Income Tax on what they earn,regulationism
"back aspiration by raising the 40p tax threshold – so that no one earning less than £50,000 pays it",regulationism
"cap overall welfare spending,",laissez-faire
"lower the amount of benefits that any household can receive to £23,000",laissez-faire
"and continue to roll out Universal Credit, to make work pay",laissez-faire
"bring in tax-free childcare to support parents back into work,",regulationism
and give working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week.,regulationism
"Under Labour, those who worked hard found more and more of their earnings taken away in tax to support a welfare system that allowed, and even encouraged, people to choose benefits when they could be earning a living.",laissez-faire
"This sent out terrible signals: if you did the right thing, you were penalised – and if you did the wrong thing, you were rewarded, with the unfairness of it all infuriating hardworking people.",laissez-faire
"Over the last five years, we have cut people’s taxes wherever possible.",regulationism
"We have raised the tax-free Personal Allowance to £10,600 from £6,475:",regulationism
over 26 million people are now keeping more of their hard-earned money,regulationism
and 3 million of the lowest paid are paying no Income Tax at all.,regulationism
"We believe that cutting people’s taxes is the right thing to do – not only because it is your money,",regulationism

"Real fairness means that where people really cannot work, they must be supported – but where they are able to work, they should.",regulationism
We have made long overdue changes to our welfare system.,laissez-faire
We have capped benefits so no household can take more in out-of-work benefits than the average household earns by going out to work.,laissez-faire
We have begun to introduce Universal Credit – a way to simplify benefits into a new single payment – so that work always pays.,laissez-faire
We are reassessing those on incapacity benefits so that help goes to those who really need it.,laissez-faire

"In the next Parliament, we will continue to reward hard work:",regulationism

"Instead, we will ease the burden of taxation by raising the tax-free Personal Allowance – the amount you can earn before you start paying tax – to £12,500.",progressivism
"This will cut Income Tax for 30 million people and take everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether.",progressivism
"That means by the end of the decade, one million more people on the lowest wages will be lifted out of Income Tax,",progressivism
and people who work for 30 hours a week on the increased National Minimum Wage will no longer pay any Income Tax at all.,progressivism
We will pass a new law so that the Personal Allowance automatically rises in line with the National Minimum Wage.,progressivism
The new Tax Free Minimum Wage law will be applied from the first Budget after the General Election.,progressivism
"The change will update the 1977 'Rooker-Wise' amendment which forced governments to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation, meaning the Personal Allowance will now increase more quickly.",progressivism

And we will help families stay together and handle the stresses of modern life by continuing to invest at least £7.5 million a year in relationship support.,conservatism
"We have already legislated to introduce tax-free childcare in the next Parliament – worth up to £2,000 per child per year – to help parents who want to work.",regulationism
We introduced 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three and four-year olds,regulationism

"Between 1997 and 2009, under the last Labour Government, we had the largest influx of people Britain had ever seen.",conservatism
"Their open borders policy, combined with their failure to reform welfare, meant that for years over 90 percent of employment growth in this country was accounted for by foreign nationals",conservatism

"For the past five years, we have been working to turn around the situation we inherited.",conservatism
"Across the spectrum, from the student route to the family and work routes, we will build a system that truly puts you, your family and the British people first.",conservatism
We have already capped the level of skilled economic migration from outside the EU.,conservatism
"We will maintain our cap at 20,700 during the next Parliament.",conservatism
This will ensure that we only grant visas to those who have the skills we really need in our economy.,conservatism
We will reform the student visa system with new measures to tackle abuse and reduce the numbers of students overstaying once their visas expire.,conservatism
"Our action will include clamping down on the number of so-called ‘satellite campuses’ opened in London by universities located elsewhere in the UK, and reviewing the highly trusted sponsor system for student visas.",conservatism

We know what works in education: great teachers; brilliant leadership; rigour in the curriculum; discipline in the classroom; proper exams.,regulationism
"We have been bold in reforming the education system to deliver these things, based upon simple, clear principles and values.",regulationism
We believe that parents and teachers should be empowered to run their schools independently.,regulationism
"We believe that teaching is a highly skilled profession, and that we need to attract the best graduates into it.",regulationism
And we believe that there is no substitute for a rigorous academic curriculum to secure the best from every pupil.,regulationism
We inherited a system where far too many children left school without the qualifications and skills they needed.,regulationism
"One in three children was leaving primary school unable to read, write and add up properly.",regulationism
The number of pupils studying the core academic subjects at GCSE had halved.,regulationism
Our schools had fallen down the global league tables for maths and science.,regulationism
And the poorest children were attending the weakest schools.,regulationism
Our far-reaching education reforms have changed this.,regulationism

"Today, there are a million more pupils in schools rated by Ofsted as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’.",regulationism
"Over a thousand schools that were ranked ‘inadequate’ have become Academies, bringing in new leadership to promote discipline, rigour and higher standards.",regulationism
There are over 250 new free schools – set up and run by local people – delivering better education for the children who need it most.,regulationism
We have boosted the number of apprenticeships to record levels – 2.2 million over the last five years,jianshe
– and last September more people headed off to university than at any time in history.,regulationism
"Too many children, however, are still not receiving the excellent education that they deserve.",regulationism
"So we will continue our reforms, so that every child has the best possible start in life.",regulationism
We have made exams more rigorous and ended grade inflation.,regulationism
There is more to do.,regulationism
We will start by introducing tough new standards for literacy and numeracy in primary schools.,regulationism

"They should be able to read a book and write a short story with accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar.",regulationism
"If children do not reach the required standards in their exams at the end of primary school, they will resit them at the start of secondary school, to make sure no pupil is left behind.",regulationism
"We will require secondary school pupils to take GCSEs in English, maths, science, a language and history or geography, with Ofsted unable to award its highest ratings to schools that refuse to teach these core subjects.",regulationism
We have more than doubled Labour’s spending on new school places.,regulationism
"But we want to go even further, investing at least £7 billion over the next Parliament to provide good school places.",regulationism
"And we will let our best headteachers take control of failing primary schools, by expanding the National Leaders of Education programme.",regulationism
"Over 4,000 schools are already benefiting from academy status, giving them more power over discipline and budgets.",regulationism
And nearly 800 of the worst-performing primary schools have been taken over by experienced academy sponsors with a proven track record of success.,regulationism
This is improving education for our children.,regulationism
"So we will continue to expand academies, free schools, studio schools and University Technical Colleges.",regulationism
"Over the next Parliament, we will open at least 500 new free schools,",regulationism
"resulting in 270,000 new school places.",regulationism
And we will introduce new powers to force coasting schools to accept new leadership.,regulationism

And we will make schools funding fairer.,regulationism
"We have already increased funding for the 69 least well-funded local authorities in the country, and will make this the baseline for their funding in the next Parliament.",regulationism
We will not allow state schools to make a profit.,regulationism
We have already given teachers greater disciplinary powers.,regulationism

"We will abolish the death penalty, which has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment.",progressivism
It has no place in the United States of America.,progressivism

"and create a path to citizenship for law-abiding families who are here, making a better life for their families and contributing to their communities and our country.",progressivism
"We should repeal the 3-year, 10-year and permanent bars, which often force persons in mixed status families into the heartbreaking dilemma of either pursuing a green card by leaving the country and their loved ones behind, or remaining in the shadows.",progressivism
We will work with Congress to end the forced and prolonged expulsion from the country that these immigrants endure when trying to adjust their status.,progressivism
We must fix family backlogs and defend against those who would exclude or eliminate legal immigration avenues and denigrate immigrants.,progressivism
